<h1 id="h_01H1PGYP08Z09JA3XGJ5QKT5A8">What Are Media Channels?</h1>
<p>Media Channels give you a new space to share videos, photos, and files with your community. Similar to Forum Channels, Media Channels are contained in posts, so you can categorize your videos, photos, or files in an easily digestible format for your community to engage with.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> In the channel list, hover over the channel category where you want your <em>Media Channel</em> to live and hit the "+" icon to Create a Channel.</p>

<p>Today, Media channel file uploads must adhere to existing Discord file limitations and compatibility. This varies based if you’re a Nitro subscriber or not.</p>
<p>**Please Note: the thumbnail preview is limited to one media item.</p>
<p><strong>File upload limits:</strong></p>
<p>Everyone — 25MB Uploads<br>Nitro Basic — 50MB Uploads <br>Nitro — 500MB Uploads</p>
<p>We recommend testing out different solutions that meet your needs. Our goal is to improve media file compatibility down the road with your feedback and input.</p>

<h1 id="h_01H1PGZ897BKCVBBVC1HQAGCJW">What Can I Do With Media Channels?</h1>
<p>There are tons of ways to use Media channels to add more value for your community but here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Early Access / Behind the Scenes / Bonus Content:</strong> You can create a Server Subscription tier which gives paying subscribers access to a Media channel.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wallpapers, PDFs, or other file downloads:</strong> Allow subscribers to view and download items from the media channel.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Share Media Posts Across Your Server:</strong> Let your community know you have a new post to view or file to download! Subscribers will be able to view or download content but subscribers wont have access unless they subscribe.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01H1PGZDGKKX8YV9AVV9HYP5GW">Bonus Content or File Downloads</h2>
<p>To enhance your Server Subscriptions offering you can you can use Media Channels to post content or files for your paying subscribers. This could be for a dedicated Server Subscriptions tier or a way to add additional value to an existing tier. To do this just:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a Media Channel and assign a new role connected to a Server Subscription tier. The subscriber will only have access to the new Media channel if they are subscribed.</li>
    <li>Start posting content! This could be short behind-the-scenes videos, images, unlisted YouTube videos or even wallpapers, files, and / or PDFs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Don’t forget to share Media channel posts across your server to drive awareness and convert more people into paying subscribers.</p>
