<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Step 1: Set Up Your Team &amp; Payout Information</strong> </span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Step 2: Accept Monetization Terms &amp; Server Subscription Policy and Select Your Team</strong> </span></p>

<h1 id="h_01GT25HNCNPHRBNS2SEC4B0C1M"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why did my server ownership transfer fail? </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This can happen for a number of different reasons, but most likely if you were unable to receive a server (or you were unable to transfer a server to someone else) - then the account receiving the server might not be eligible for Server Subscriptions. </p>
<p>Please ensure the account that the server is being transferred to meets our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983-Discord-Server-Subscription-Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Subscriptions eligibility requirements</a> <strong>AND</strong> has set up <a href="https://discord.com/creators/server-subs-payout-onboarding-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team and payment info</a>.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: What happens to earnings if my server ownership transfer fails?</strong> </span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>If a server transfer fails, the ownership and payout info reverts back to the original owner. Eligible payouts will continue to go to the original owner.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Q: I was transferred a server with Server Subscriptions but I cannot fulfill the benefits and perks that were sold by the previous owner, what should I do? </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> As the new owner of the server, it is your responsibility to fulfill all perks or benefits associated with the active Server Subscriptions. You must communicate with subscribers about changes to perks and benefits. </p>
<p>If you materially change what you are offering subscribers, or you’re unable to provide all perks and benefits for active subscribers, you must offer a refund to subscribers.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Q: I had a few active Server Subscriptions but have not reached the $100 threshold for payment, when will I be paid out?</strong> </span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>If you have earned money, but have not reached the $100 threshold for payout before transferring ownership, then the money earned to date will be paid out to you once the new owner reaches $100 of revenue earned since the ownership transfer and is approved for payout in accordance with our regular payout schedule. </p>
<p>If the new owner does not satisfy all eligibility requirements for payout, you will not be eligible for a payout.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Q: What happens if I transfer the server to someone who then violates the Server Subscription Policy?</strong> </span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If the new server owner violates any applicable terms or policies, including the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Subscriptions Policy</a>, we may apply any remedies referenced in our terms or policies. </p>
<p>For Server Subscriptions, this can include issuing refunds to all active subscribers, payout ineligibility, or any other remedies referenced in the applicable terms. </p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the previous and new server owners to resolve any issues with respect to transferred servers and accrued payouts and to ensure that owners operate in compliance with applicable terms and policies.</p>
