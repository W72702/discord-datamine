<p id="docs-internal-guid-90abc51d-7fff-4bb4-c2c9-a18de0d90903">Discord has partnered with <a href="https://influencers.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencers Club</a> to conduct outreach to creators who are not currently on Discord to discuss partnership opportunities. This could include creating a server for their existing fans, monetizing their community using our Server Subscriptions product, or other initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Influencers Club will send emails to creators on our behalf using an @influencers.club email address.</strong> If you receive an email and donâ€™t want to be contacted by Influencers Club again, please reply to their email and ask them to remove you from future outreach.</p>
