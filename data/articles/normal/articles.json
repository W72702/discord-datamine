This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H9TR0SB26YVDK1DKK5XYESDW\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9TR0SB2QWAAKC4WHDTMXZC4\"><strong>Potential Errors and Other Issues</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I didn't receive an email from Synced with the Nitro promo link, even if I'm Synced player?</strong></p>\n<p>A: In order to receive an email from Synced with the Nitro promo link, you must be a Synced player.</p>\n<p>Additionally, make sure that you've opted to receive marketing emails from Synced. If you've unsubscribed, you sadly won't be able to see this offer. </p>\n<p>If you believe you are eligible for the promotion, contact Synced's support team by heading over to their <a href=\"https://www.syncedthegame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official website</a> and navigating to their Help Support page. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a Sad Trombone error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p>A: Would you happen to be entering this Nitro promo link from the promotion into the Discord Gift Inventory or as a link within Discord chat?</p>\n<p>If so, this is the incorrect method for redeeming the Nitro promo link, and you will see an error when attempting to redeem the promotion.</p>\n<p>In order to successfully claim this promotion, try opening up an incognito browser and then copy and pasting the promotion link into your browser's address bar (also known as a location bar or URL bar). </p>\n<p>Alternatively, in the Discord Gift Inventory, enter only your unique 24-digit code from the Nitro promotion link in the following format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro subscription so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on. Or you can give the promotion link to a friend who hasn't had Nitro before.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk. However, this promo link can be gifted to a friend.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been redeemed\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a \"This gift has been redeemed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo link has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've redeemed this promo link on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>In particular, if you redeemed this promo link using your mobile device, double check the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo link has been redeemed, the promo link cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the link is invalid. If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link sent to your email.</p>\n<p>If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their email.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo link!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’m having trouble with my Synced account.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are running into trouble with your Synced account, you can reach out to Synced support by heading over to their <a href=\"https://www.syncedthegame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official website</a> and navigating to their Help Support page. </p>\n<p> </p>"

This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no!

If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link sent to your email.</p>\n<p>If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their email.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo link!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’m having trouble with my Genshin Impact account.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are having issues redeeming this promotion on your Genshin Impact account, you can reach out to your region’s Genshin Impact support team at: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ZH region: <a href=\"mailto:genshin_cs@nijigengames.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genshin_cs@nijigengames.com</a>\n</li>\n<li>JP region: <a href=\"mailto:genshin_jp@hoyoverse.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genshin_jp@hoyoverse.com</a>\n</li>\n<li>DE, EN, ES, FR, ID, IT, KR, PT, RU, HT, TR, and VN regions：<a href=\"mailto:genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com</a> </li>\n</ul>"

Canadian residents must answer a skill-testing question before a prize will be awarded. Unless Discord is satisfied that a potential winner is eligible to win a prize, every potential winner must sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility. An affidavit of eligibility is a document in which the signatory (the potential winner) legally declares that they are eligible to win the prize based on these Discord Sweepstakes Terms. If Discord asks a potential winner to sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility, they must do so within thirty (30) days of the date the affidavit is sent to claim their prize. If a potential winner cannot be contacted or fails to return the affidavit of eligibility within the required time period, the potential winner forfeits the prize.

If a potential winner is disqualified because they failed to comply with these Discord Sweepstakes Terms, or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, Discord will award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing held by Discord from among all remaining eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Term. Discord will conduct these alternative random drawings for each prize until the prize is claimed. Winners are solely responsible for any taxes or reporting obligations resulting from the prizes. Prizes are not transferable. No substitutions or exchanges of any prize (including for cash) will be permitted.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H3X7P7WMJYHYP14KWHV3WZG9\"><strong>Potential Errors and Other Issues</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I didn't receive an email from SoundCloud with the Nitro promo link, even if I'm a SoundCloud Next or SoundCloud NextPro user?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> In order to receive an email from SoundCloud with the Nitro promo link, you must be a SoundCloud Next or SoundCloud Next Pro user.</p>\n<p>Additionally, make sure that you've opted to receive marketing emails from SoundCloud.

It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro subscription so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on. Or you can give the promotion link to a friend who hasn't had Nitro before.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month/3 month perk.

You may need to double check if you've redeemed this promo link on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>In particular, if you redeem this promo link using your mobile device, doublecheck the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo link has been redeemed, the promo link cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the link is invalid. If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link sent to your email.</p>\n<p>If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their email.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo link!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’m having trouble with my SoundCloud Next or SoundCloud NextPro account.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Reach out to SoundCloud’’s support team: <a href=\"https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us</a></p>"

ALL ENTRIES MUST COMPLY WITH THESE OFFICIAL RULES, AND BE SUBMITTED DURING THE SWEEPSTAKES TERM, OR THEY WILL BE DISQUALIFIED. YOU MAY ONLY SUBMIT ONE (1) ENTRY PER DAY DURING THE SWEEPSTAKES TERM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">If you submit more than one entry in a day using the same account, only the first entry for that day will be considered, and all subsequent entries for that day will be disqualified. Your entry must not: (i) violate any applicable law or regulation; (ii) violate any third-party rights, including copyrights, trademark rights, moral rights, or rights of privacy and publicity; (iii) contain disparaging or defamatory statements; (iv) include threats to any person, place, business, or group; (v) be obscene, offensive, or indecent; (vi) depict any risky behavior; (vii) contain material that promotes bigotry, racism, hatred or harm against any group or individual or promotes discrimination based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; and/or (viii) contain unauthorized third-party trademarks or logos (collectively, the “<em><strong>Content Restrictions</strong></em>”).<br>All of your entries will be disqualified if: (i) any of your entries violates any of the Content Restrictions; (ii) you attempt to use more than one Instagram or Twitter account to submit entries to the Sweepstakes; or (iii) you attempt to cheat, tamper with the systems or services used to operate the Sweepstakes, or otherwise interfere with or undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes. If Discord does not receive your entry for any reason outside of Discord’s control, your entry will be disqualified. <strong>You must obtain the consent of any individual other than yourself whose personal information you include in any submission you post.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">5. Prizes &amp; Approximate Retail Value. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">A total of two prizes will be awarded to winners selected at random, with a total approximate retail value (“</span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #222222;\">ARV</span></em></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">”) of US$240, as described below, one prize for entrants who enter via Twitter and one prize for entrants who enter via Instagram. Each entrant may win one (1) prize only, </span>so if there are not enough eligible entries, not all prizes will be awarded: </p>\n<p>Each prize consists of: <span style=\"color: #222222;\">1 Discord customized Elgato mic (AVR $120) and 1 Discord customized Elgato Streamdeck (AVR $120) .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">The potential winners will be notified via the account they used to submit their entry </span>on or about July 5, 2023<span style=\"color: #222222;\">, and mus</span>t respond to the notification attempt within three (3) days of when it was sent. To receive a prize, a potential winner must: (i) submit all information that Discord requires to deliver them their prize and comply with applicable laws; and (ii) acknowledge that Discord may disclose their name and country to third parties because certain laws require Discord to do so to demonstrate the fairness of these Sweepstakes. Canadian residents must answer a skill-testing question before a prize will be awarded. Unless Discord is satisfied that a potential winner is eligible to win a prize, every potential winner must sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility. An affidavit of eligibility is a document in which the signatory legally declares that they are eligible to win the prize based on these Official Rules. If Discord asks a potential winner to sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility, they must do so within thirty (30) days of the date the affidavit is sent to claim their prize. If a potential winner cannot be contacted or fails to return the affidavit of eligibility within the required time period, the potential winner forfeits the prize. Discord will cover the costs of shipping prizes to <span style=\"color: #222222;\">winn</span>ers. In the event that a potential winner is disqualified because they failed to comply with these Official Rules, or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, Discord will award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing held by Discord from among all remaining eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Term. Discord will conduct these alternative random drawings for each prize until the prize is claimed. Winners are solely responsible for any taxes or reporting obligations resulting from the prizes. Prizes are not transferable. No substitutions or exchanges of any prize (including for cash) will be permitted. Any difference between the stated ARV and actual value of a prize will not be awarded.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">6. Odds. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">The odds of winning a prize is equal to the number of Sweepstakes prizes divided by the total number of entries to the Sweepstakes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">7. Limitation of Liability. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">This Section does not apply to you if you reside in France, Germany or Great Britain. You agree that Discord Parties, Twitter, Instagram, and their respective affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents (collectively, the “</span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Released Parties</span></em></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">”), shall not be responsible or liable for any losses, damages or injuries of any kind resulting from your participation in the Sweepstakes or any Sweepstakes-related activity, unless occasioned by their negligence or willful misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">8. Indemnification. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">This Section does not apply to you if you reside in France, Germany or Great Britain. By participating in the Sweepstakes and/or accepting any prize that may be awarded, t</span>o the maximum extent permitted by law, <span style=\"color: #222222;\">you agree to fully indemnify each Released Party from </span>and against any liability, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses resulting from any breach by you of these Official Rules or any misrepresentation made by you in connection with the Sweepstakes.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">9. Uncontrollable Events.</span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\"> In the event the operation or integrity of the Sweepstakes are compromised by an event beyond Discord’s reasonable control and which were unforeseeable before the Sweepstakes began, Discord may suspend, modify or terminate the Sweepstakes. Should the Sweepstakes be terminated prior to the stated expiration date, Discord may award prizes based on the entries received before the termination date. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">10. Disputes. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Official Rules and any Claim that arises between you and Discord. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">11. Class Action Waiver. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">This Section does not apply to you if you reside in France, Germany or Great Britain. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“</span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Class Action</span></em></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court, you and Discord each waive any right to a jury trial.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">12. Construction.</span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\"> The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any such provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, these rules shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained therein. Discord’s failure to enforce any of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">13. Winner List.</span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\"> Discord takes commercially reasonable steps to comply with laws that apply to the Sweepstakes, including laws in Great Britain, the U.S. and elsewhere that require Discord to demonstrate the fairness of these Sweepstakes. As such, in accordance with applicable laws, Discord will make available to you a copy of the name and country of the winner(s) and/or or a copy of these Official Rules, for one month after the Sweepstakes Term, if you send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: Discord Inc., Attn: “Winner List/Official Rules” for Discord Elgato Streamkit Giveaway, </span>444 De Haro Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94107<span style=\"color: #222222;\">. </span>(Residents of Vermont need not supply postage).</p>\n<p><strong>14.

What information about me will apps have access to? </strong></p>\n<p>A: Your messages will not be read by an app if you decide to add it to a direct message or group message. When you interact with an app in a DM or group message, along with the interaction information (e.g., your command to the app), the app can also access your basic profile information (e.g., username, user ID, avatar, banner, and public flags like the badges you have) and selected language. As a reminder, these apps have been developed by third parties so before you choose to use an app, you should review any terms and policies provided by the developer as they apply to your use.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can you remove an app from a DM or group message?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There are two ways to remove an app. First, you can right-click on an App in the DM or group message and tap on <strong>Remove App</strong> to remove the app at any time. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Second, you can tap directly on the profile of the app and then click on <strong>Remove App</strong>. A notification will appear in the DM or group message stating the app was removed.<img style=\"height: 145px; width: 346px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3okY1oaDg46PAIqPs3_m0TQKJNUmwYZVXIujkZJgyA9IAy6sARH8KBOGQhHW1N53k9rGT4BcT9d13Q-cwc6C8l42HGtdGsowD5znBwI2--ISrDjnmH8bDTmwW1jp-MLoeb8oAM4dk5sGNrvikcQZnts\"><img style=\"height: 437px; width: 233px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sOsQSWIe3A-AVJm0aWkEMcFfwjXhRAJ-YjOTb-pnR-2GgMLT3BNTQ8b4j49ETHdqVGGi6ek5kekWf-UdImv6WIVdX0HQ__PkV7ujrsEEuzgJwuR0h7z1mDsiiNCWNsPaTg3yl2_ARiKFSFLPF2saEn0\"></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What can I do if the app isn’t working or I’m having issues with it?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The developer of the app (not Discord) is responsible for the app. If you experience issues with an app, please contact the developer (e.g., through a support server they maintain).

Alternatively, you can press the <strong>Home button</strong> at the top left of your client and then select the <strong>Nitro tab</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/16207557947159\" alt=\"summerslamnitro2023-page.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0553c96-7fff-0c6a-3965-8ded0a424d71\">Note: You cannot claim this promotion through the mobile (iOS and Android) apps.

If you select the Yearly option - you will only receive 1 month of free Nitro - not 1 year.</h3>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Receive Your Free Month</strong></p>\n<p>Upon successful completion of the payment, your account will be upgraded to Nitro!</p>\n<p>Your free additional month of Nitro will automatically be applied after the end of your first month or year subscription.</p>\n<h1 id=\"docs-internal-guid-8c05a3fa-7fff-9959-21c9-99121fd7042c\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Q: I don't see the promotion details on my Nitro tab. Why?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you don't see any promotion details on your Nitro tab on the desktop or browser (this promotion is not available on the mobile clients), it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I subscribe to Nitro Yearly during this promotion, what will I receive?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you subscribe to Nitro Yearly during this promotion, you will receive 1 month of Nitro for free at the end of your yearly subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I upgrade my subscription from Nitro Basic or Nitro Classic to Nitro, can I receive this promotion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, this promotion applies for upgrades from Nitro Basic or Classic to Nitro.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How much will I be charged if I upgrade my plan to Nitro?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The amount you'll be charged for upgrading to Nitro depends on:<br>1. Whether you're upgrading from Basic or Classic<br>2. The amount of your existing subscription plan you haven’t used<br>3. The remaining amount of your new subscription plan you will use after upgrading</p>\n<p>For example, if you’ve only used ⅓ of your existing Nitro Basic monthly plan this month and decide to upgrade to Nitro for the remainder of this month, we would first refund you the remaining ⅔ of your Basic plan that you haven’t used. After, you would then pay the remaining amount of time this month - in this case, ⅔ of this month - on your new Nitro plan.</p>\n<p>This way, you only pay for what you use when upgrading. If you’ve only used 10 days of Nitro Basic this month, you should only have to pay Basic’s price for those 10 days you used. And if you only have 20 days left this month after upgrading to your new Nitro plan, you should only have to pay Nitro’s price for those 20 days, not the entire month.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I claimed and redeemed a different free trial for Discord Nitro already. Can I access this promo?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Unfortunately, if you are currently on a free trial, you are not eligible for this promotion.

How To Enter. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">You may enter the Sweepstakes by liking and replying to the official Discord Twitter post. ALL ENTRIES MUST COMPLY WITH THESE OFFICIAL RULES, AND BE SUBMITTED DURING THE SWEEPSTAKES TERM, OR THEY WILL BE DISQUALIFIED. YOU MAY ONLY SUBMIT </span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">ONE (1) ENTRY PER DAY DURING THE SWEEPSTAKES TERM. </span></p>\n<p>You may also enter the Sweepstakes without <span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">liking and replying to the official Discord Twitter post</span> by emailing giveaways@discordapp.com with an email that includes the phrase “Enter me into Discord’s Wumpus Wonderventures Comic Giveaway sweepstakes.” If you submit more than one entry in a day using the same account, only the first entry for that day will be considered, and all subsequent entries for that day will be disqualified. Your entry must not: (i) violate any applicable law or regulation; (ii) violate any third-party rights, including copyrights, trademark rights, moral rights, or rights of privacy and publicity; (iii) contain disparaging or defamatory statements; (iv) include threats to any person, place, business, or group; (v) be obscene, offensive, or indecent; (vi) depict any risky behavior; (vii) contain material that promotes bigotry, racism, hatred or harm against any group or individual or promotes discrimination based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; and/or (viii) contain unauthorized third-party trademarks or logos (collectively, the “<strong><em>Content Restrictions</em></strong>”).</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">All of your entries will be disqualified if: (i) any of your entries violates any of the Content Restrictions; (ii) you attempt to use more than one</span> Twitter account to submit entries to the Sweepstakes; or (iii) you attempt to cheat, tamper with the systems or services used to operate the Sweepstakes, or otherwise interfere with or undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweeps<span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">takes. If Discord does not receive your entry for any reason outside of Discord’s control, your entry will be disqualified. </span><strong>You must obtain the consent of any individual other than yourself whose personal information you include in any submission you post.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">5. Prizes &amp; Approximate Retail Value. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">A total of one hundred prizes will be awarded to winners selected at random, with a total approximate retail value (“</span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #222222;\">ARV</span></em></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">”) of US$500, as described below. Each entrant may win one (1) prize only, </span>so if there are not enough eligible entries, not all prizes will be awarded. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #222222;\">GRAND PRIZE: 100 (100) grand prizes will be awarded, consisting of a physical print comic of Wumpus Wonderventures. ARV of the Grand Prize is US$5.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">The potential winners will be notified via the Twitter account they used to submit their entry </span>by or before June 30, 2023 10:00 AM PST<span style=\"color: #222222;\">, and mus</span>t respond to the notification attempt within three (3) days of when it was sent. To receive a prize, a potential winner must: (i) submit all information that Discord requires to deliver them their prize and comply with applicable laws; and (ii) acknowledge that Discord may disclose their name and country to third parties because certain laws require Discord to do so to demonstrate the fairness of these Sweepstakes. Canadian residents must answer a skill-testing question before a prize will be awarded. Unless Discord is satisfied that a potential winner is eligible to win a prize, every potential winner must sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility. An affidavit of eligibility is a document in which the signatory legally declares that they are eligible to win the prize based on these Official Rules. If Discord asks a potential winner to sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility, they must do so within thirty (30) days of the date the affidavit is sent to claim their prize. If a potential winner cannot be contacted or fails to return the affidavit of eligibility within the required time period, the potential winner forfeits the prize. Discord will cover the costs of shipping prizes to <span style=\"color: #222222;\">winn</span>ers. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">In the event that a potential winner is disqualified because they failed to comply with these Official Rules, or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, Discord will award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing held by Discord from among all remaining eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Term. Discord will conduct these alternative random drawings for each prize until the prize is claimed. Winners are solely responsible for any taxes or reporting obligations resulting from the prizes.</span> Prizes are not transferable. No substitutions or exchanges of any prize (including for cash) will be permitted. Any difference between the stated ARV and actual value of a prize will not be awarded.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">6. Odds. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">The odds of winning a prize is equal to the number of Sweepstakes prizes divided by the total number of entries to the Sweepstakes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">7. Limitation of Liability. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">This Section does not apply to you if you reside in France, Germany or Great Britain. You agree that Discord Parties, </span><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Twitter, and their respective affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents (collectively, the “</span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Released Parties</span></em></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">”), s</span><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">hall not be responsible or liable for any losses, damages or injuries of any kind resulting from your participation in the Sweepstakes or any Sweepstakes-related activity, unless occasioned by their negligence or willful misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">8. Indemnification. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">This Section does not apply to you if you reside in France, Germany or Great Britain. By participating in the Sweepstakes and/or accepting any prize that may be awarded, t</span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">o the maximum extent permitted by law, </span><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">you agree to fully indemnify each Released Party from </span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">and against any liability, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses resulting from any breach by you of these Official Rules or any misrepresentation made by you in connection with the Sweepstakes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">9. Uncontrollable Events.</span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\"> In the event the operation or integrity of the Sweepstakes are compromised by an event beyond Discord’s reasonable control and which were unforeseeable before the Sweepstakes began, Discord may suspend, modify or terminate the Sweepstakes. Should the Sweepstakes be terminated prior to the stated expiration date, Discord may award prizes based on the entries received before the termination date. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">10. Disputes. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Official Rules and any Claim that arises between you and Discord. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">11. Class Action Waiver. </span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">This Section does not apply to you if you reside in France, Germany or Great Britain. </span><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“</span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Class Action</span></em></strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\">”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court, you and Discord each waive any right to a jury trial.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">12. Construction.</span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\"> The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any such provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, these rules shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained therein. Discord’s failure to enforce any of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\">13. Winner List.</span></strong><span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;\"> Discord takes commercially reasonable steps to comply with laws that apply to the Sweepstakes, including laws in Great Britain, the U.S. and elsewhere that require Discord to demonstrate the fairness of these Sweepstakes. As such, in accordance with applicable laws, Discord will make available to you a copy of the name and country of the winner(s) and/or or </span><span style=\"color: #222222;\">a copy of these Official Rules, for one month after the Sweepstakes Term, if you send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: Discord Inc., Attn: “Winner List/Official Rules” for Discord Wumpus Wonderventures Comic Giveaway Sweepstakes, </span>444 De Haro Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94107<span style=\"color: #222222;\">. </span>(Residents of Vermont need not supply postage).</p>\n<p><strong>14.

These laws are intended to ensure that we run the Event fairly and in compliance with applicable laws. If you are selected as a potential winner of the Event, a condition of claiming a prize and becoming a winner of the Event is that we may disclose your name and country for this purpose. This is a necessary part of our contract with you when you accept a prize to win the Event because our contract requires us to comply with the laws that apply to us and applicable laws require us to make these disclosures. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for this disclosure is to perform our contract with you to run the Event in accordance with applicable laws, or else to advance our legitimate interests in running an Event that complies with applicable laws.

How can I update their age?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When a user signs up for Discord, we ask for their age to verify that they meet the minimum age requirement in their country. It sounds like your teen may have made an error when inputting their date of birth. To correct this, please have your teen contact Discord at<a href=\"http://dis.gd/request\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> dis.gd/request</a> &gt; <strong>Update My Age Information</strong>. Be sure to have them include their actual age in their request.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I flag inappropriate activity to Discord?</strong></p>\n<p>A: As a parent, we encourage you to spend some time reviewing and discussing your teen’s settings so that you can customize their Discord experience and avoid unwanted experiences. You can learn more about Discord’s safety settings <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360043653552-age-restricted-content-on-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if your teen encounters a violation of our Community Guidelines please have them submit an in-app report of the behavior by <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">following the instructions here</a>.</p>\n<p>In sensitive situations, if you would like to report the behavior on your teen's behalf, you can do so by <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">following the instructions here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: My teen won't allow me to connect Family Center, how can I make them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Both parents/guardians and teens must voluntarily opt into connecting to Family Center. If your teen has additional questions about information shared via Family Center they can learn more <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14155060633623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. We encourage you to talk with your teen to customize a Discord experience that is right for the whole family.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can't I link to my teen’s account? </strong></p>\n<p>A: If a user has their age set to 18 or older, you will not be able to link to their account. Your teen will have to correct their age on Discord before you are able to link to the account.</p>\n<p>To do this, please have your teen contact Discord at<a href=\"http://dis.gd/request\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> dis.gd/request</a> &gt; <strong>Update My Age Information</strong>. Be sure to have them include their actual age in their request.</p>\n<p>Please note that Discord has minimum age requirements depending on the country your teen is in.

We encourage you to talk to your teen about how to customize settings in a way that supports your family's safety goals.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Discord's settings <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I join a server my teen is in?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Every server on Discord is different and each has their own custom join settings and rules around invites to fit the needs of the community.</p>\n<p>To learn more about a server your teen is a part of, we encourage you to discuss and review the server together.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can't I see all of my teens' friends?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Family Center is designed to provide parents with their teens' recent activity. At this time we only provide information about their activity on Discord within the last seven days. This includes the number of users they’ve messaged or called, the number of new friends they’ve added, and how many servers they’re actively participating in. Family Center won’t contain a complete archive of activity and will only highlight activity occurring after your teen has accepted your connection request. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I make changes to my teen's friend list or joined servers?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Family Center does not allow any connected parent to make modifications or changes to their teen’s friend list or joined servers on their teen’s behalf. For security and privacy reasons, only account owners can make modifications on their account. </p>\n<p>As a parent/guardian, we encourage you to leverage Family Center as a way to spend some time reviewing and discussing your teen’s settings so that you can help customize their Discord experience. We’ve outlined some discussion starters and tips for helping keep your teen safe on Discord here:<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord</a></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many teens can I connect to in Family Center?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Parents and guardians are able to connect to a maximum of 8 accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I don't want my teen talking to this user, can I do anything?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you feel uncomfortable with someone your teen is engaging with, we encourage you to talk to your teen about your concerns. We want to make you aware of the <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-Helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-Discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tools available to your teen on Discord</a>, such as our explicit image and spam filters. You can also block specific users who you or your teen do not wish to communicate with anymore. Instructions on how to do so can be found <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Discord takes our teen users' security and safety very seriously. If you believe there is a violation of our Community Guidelines, we ask that you report this behavior to us. You can find more information on how to submit a request <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I accidentally remove my teen’s connection, do they need to re-allow me to connect?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes. For security and privacy reasons, once a parent has disconnected from a teen, they must go through the connection process again in order to re-establish their connection with that teen.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I see if another user is connected to my teen in Family Center?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, connected parents and guardians can see every account their teen has connected to in Family Center. An email confirmation with the newly linked account will be sent to the email address associated to the parent/guardian Discord account.</p>"

However, Friends Servers are more intimate and enclosed spaces where users generate new invite links to send to friends. We found that nearly 100% of links were clicked within 30 days, reducing the likelihood of a negative impact on Friends Servers.</span></p>"

Redeeming a free trial simply requires that you enter a payment method to begin the free trial.</p>\n<p>If you don’t cancel during your 2-week trial, you<strong> will </strong>automatically be charged $9.99/month after your trial ends. Cancel anytime during your trial to avoid being charged after your trial period in User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Cancel.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What devices is this available on?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nitro subscribers can only share a Nitro trial on a desktop device.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if someone doesn’t redeem the Nitro trial I shared with them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Recipients have up to 48 hours to redeem your Nitro trial.

Clyde accesses the information needed to power the feature, such as messages where users interact with it, user profiles, and server information to help it better understand the context, generate more relevant responses, and facilitate a free-flowing conversation. Like with other Discord features, we store and use information as described in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Privacy Policy</a>. While Clyde currently uses OpenAI technology, OpenAI may only use and store your data to help us provide and support Clyde. OpenAI may not use your data to train its general models.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I send direct messages to Clyde?</strong></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-f8687c4b-7fff-fce0-88d0-7becb04918e5\">A: Yes - if you’re in a server where Clyde is available, you can direct message Clyde by viewing Clyde’s profile &amp; pressing on <strong>Message Clyde</strong> or searching “Clyde” in the search bar in your Direct Messages. In addition, Clyde may also be available in group messages you’re in for you and your friends to invoke by mentioning @Clyde or replying to a Clyde message.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6bb1f928-7fff-5103-7ab9-74bf0db25195\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I add Clyde to my server?</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6d7e1e1e-7fff-7555-8306-a6985c39df0e\">A:</span> Unlike bots, Clyde is not available for Admins to add to servers—in fact, we’re building it into Discord! For now, we have selected a small, random sample of servers to test Clyde out and make improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why is Discord using OpenAI technology for Clyde?</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-265e00c3-7fff-96a7-e2a0-1d453d2b1ffd\">A: We are experimenting with Clyde using OpenAI technology today, however this may change or expand to include or use other AI models in the future.</span></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-cd7408fb-7fff-9897-4291-f23a330544ce\"><strong>Q: Why is Clyde giving me strange responses?</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-86fb98eb-7fff-b6e4-a6bc-b7892df582db\">A: Clyde is experimental and not perfect so you might come across information that could be considered biased, misleading, harmful or inaccurate, even with safeguards in place. Clyde may also not have information, or be able to respond to every prompt. Clyde’s answers are generated based on the user’s prompt to it and the data sources fueling the OpenAI technology, <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e7c84822-7fff-e371-df40-2744507a8431\">and web searches it’s able to conduct using search terms it generates based on the prompt. </span>. Accordingly, Clyde may also have limited or outdated knowledge of the world and events, and it also has limited context when it comes to the specifics of your server. </span></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-bbe4edb3-7fff-dc1d-9146-9661e66a39ac\">When using Clyde, users are required to follow our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terms of Service</a> as well as OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/disallowed-usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usage policies</a> and are responsible if they exploit Clyde to generate disallowed content.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I moderate Clyde?</strong></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-2b94a5d8-7fff-9519-fd20-e59378e8b2a3\">A: Messages from Clyde can be moderated as if they were from any member. Server Admins can delete and report messages from Clyde. Additionally, Admins can utilize Discord’s <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AutoMod</a> to auto-enforce server safety.</p>\n<p>When using Clyde, users are required to follow our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terms of Service</a> as well as OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usage policies</a> and are responsible if they exploit Clyde to generate disallowed content.</p>\n<p> </p>"

This takes away time where you can be responding to and participating in a conversation more immediately.</p>\n<p>To address this, our team at Discord is introducing <strong>Summaries</strong>. We are experimenting with the power of OpenAI technology to quickly surface topics in any text channel, get a conversation preview and the number of messages in a specific topic, and indicate who is in the discussion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img style=\"height: 363px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14289414377751\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Being able to quickly jump back into a conversation has become that much easier no matter how much you’ve missed. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GZCN63BB0DK01FJ548S78Z72\">How to enable Summaries AI</h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GZCN676DAXZD7WCKDATJV1BG\">Desktop</h2>\n<p>To turn on Summaries for your server, go to your <strong>Server Settings &gt; Overview</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img style=\"height: 353px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14289439203095\"></strong></p>\n<h2>Mobile</h2>\n<p>Summaries are not yet available on mobile, but will be available soon.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GZCN6B7ECC170H5MNAKHVJG3\">Where to find the Summaries AI?</h1>\n<p>Currently, there are two main ways to see topics in a channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Topic Subheader</strong></p>\n<p>When in a text channel, you’ll now see a new subheader showing the currently viewed topic.

This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GV71CGRA21FD8EQM2VWYSAMC\"><strong>Potential Errors and Other Issues</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

This lets you have the same username as someone else as long as you have different discriminators or different case letters. However, this also means you have to remember a set of 4-digit numbers and account for case sensitivity to connect with your friends. </p>\n<p>We wanted to make it easier for you to identify and add your friends while preserving your ability to use your preferred name across Discord.

Eventually, all users will be required to pick a new username to access Discord.</span> We will let you know in the app when that time is approaching. However, we suggest that you pick a new username when you become eligible, as that is when you will have the best chance of getting the username you want.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q. What is the difference between usernames, display names, and nicknames?</strong></p>\n<p>A. <strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0809674f-7fff-044f-108f-5e2af7fee743\">New Usernames</span></strong>, <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-627c2ece-7fff-fda5-21a9-177fd0a2319a\">also referred to as Unique Usernames, are unique to each user and serve as a unique identifier for each user.</span> You can use them to add friends and verify who you are talking to on Discord.<br><strong>Display Names</strong>, are how you show up across Discord. Display names are not unique to each user and can be set to whatever you want, whenever you want (within <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord’s Community Guidelines</a>). <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">In direct messages, friend requests, and servers where you do not have a server nickname, you will appear as your display name.</span><br><strong>Friend nicknames </strong>are names that you set for other users for your DMs. You can see the friend nicknames that you set for your friends in your DMs, but they cannot see them from their app. Friend nicknames take priority over display names where they are set in the app.<br><strong>Server nicknames</strong> are names that you either set for yourself in specific servers OR are set for you in a server by someone with permissions. Server nicknames take priority over display names where they are set in the app.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. How will I know if my friend is using an old username or a new username?</strong></p>\n<p>A. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8568d58f-7fff-6c84-bfca-f255086ce00d\">Old usernames have a tag with discriminators at the end (#0000), can be uppercase or lowercase, and use special characters. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-bf459cff-7fff-7e38-4f72-0d681cadf29a\">New usernames are all lowercase, and alphanumeric.</span><br></span></p>\n<p><strong>Q. I dismissed the notification letting me know I can change my username, how can I update my Username?</strong></p>\n<p>A. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b097b39b-7fff-c8ed-c9cb-bcee9cd98f53\">You can update your username both on the Desktop/Browser app and the Mobile app:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desktop/Browser App:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-41fd6a90-7fff-fc79-790a-fdd889adb247\">Go to </span><strong>User Settings &gt; My Account</strong> page.

Once I change my username can I go back to having a discriminator?</strong></p>\n<p>A. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-1436c758-7fff-5058-aa55-2e5903c87ccc\">No, once you pick a new username, you will no longer have a discriminator as part of your username. Remember, we’re getting rid of discriminators for everyone. When you change your username again, you will not have the option of providing a discriminator or reverting to your old username with the discriminator.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q. Will new usernames or display names be locked behind a Nitro subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>A. No. These changes are for all users.</p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-c0c9e4dc-7fff-2a4c-1085-bc8583b3974b\"><strong>Q. What if I want to cancel my Nitro subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>A.

Video codec is a key component when it comes to high quality streams. This means that the better the codec, the better the video quality.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GRYP19WAYHBHKDVT855HNSM1\"><a href=\"#h_01GRYP19WAYHBHKDVT855HNSM1\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is H.264?</span></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">H.264 is a very widely adopted technical standard of video codec. Almost every device nowadays (this includes both desktop and mobile devices) uses a software and hardware codec that is compatible with the H.264 standard. Since H.264 was developed in the early 2000’s, the encoding algorithms were targeted mainly for standard definition (480p) video compression.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GRYP1FMKTKBCHQ198JCPM0Q1\"><a href=\"#h_01GRYP1FMKTKBCHQ198JCPM0Q1\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is AV1?</span></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AV1 is one of the latest technical standards of video codec. It is developed by AOM (Alliance for open media), which is sponsored by most key players in video communications like Google, Apple, Netflix, and Meta. It uses the most sophisticated algorithms to improve video compression efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast to H.264, AV1 is developed to better support HD/UHD video communications, especially 4k, or even 8k, video applications. The AV1 codec employed by Discord presents up to 100% higher compression efficiency than its H.264 counterpart for 4K 60fps videos. Enabling AV1 can significantly boost streaming quality.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GRYP1Q09P9ZNK7EABMJGT99V\"><a href=\"#h_01GRYP1Q09P9ZNK7EABMJGT99V\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Can I Find These Video Codec Options?</span></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To enable or disable these Video Codec options, press on the cog-wheel in the lower left corner of your Discord desktop client to access your </span><strong>User Settings</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once there, you’ll want to head to </span><strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> located under </span><strong>App Settings</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, you’ll head down to the section that is called </span><strong>Video Codec</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Add Default Channels</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, head over to <strong>Server Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Onboarding</strong> and start the setup process by adding Default Channels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Default Channels will be the channels that all new members will see in their channel list when joining your Community.

Create Customization Questions</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members will answer Customization Questions to pick additional channels and roles. Create a question, give it some answers, and then assign relevant channels and/or roles for each answer choice.

    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Discord, a raid is when a large number of users or bots join a server at once for disruptive or malicious intents and purposes. Raiding is against our Terms of Service </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guidelines</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are different types of behavior and activities that raiders engage in, there are a number of steps you can take to prevent raids of all types before they occur, or minimize damage as they’re happening.</span></p>\n<h1>Raid prevention tips:</h1>\n<p>1. <strong>Turn on <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AutoMod</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Go to </strong></em><em><strong>Server Settings &gt; AutoMod</strong></em></span></p>\n<p>AutoMod lets you detect and block undesirable messages before they’re ever posted. Prevent raids from happening by using AutoMod to proactively identify potential raiders via alerts and block their messages from being posted in your server.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s how:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Create your own Custom Rules to detect raiders</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Enter keywords or phrases you think raiders may post in your server - or what they may have posted in the past - in the event of a raid. Turn on the “Send alert” response to receive alerts that allow you to identify potential raiders, and the “Block message” response to have AutoMod prevent raiders’ messages from being posted in your server when containing any of your keywords.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip: You can set up AutoMod to work as an alert system for potential raiders without resorting to blocking people’s messages from the get-go by turning on “Send alert” and turning off “Block message” in your rules.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Customize your Block Mention Spam rule </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Mention raids are when raiders join your server to annoy or expose your members to undesirable content by spamming mentions via @usernames or @roles. To minimize the likelihood of raiders pulling this off successfully, turn on AutoMod’s “Block Mention Spam” rule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set a mention limit you think works best for your server, and enable “Block message,” “Send alert”, and/or “Timeout member” responses. This way, members can’t post messages containing an excessive number of unique mentions.</span></p>\n<p>2.<strong> Disable @here and @everyone permissions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Select a non-Admin or non-Moderator role &gt; Toggle off “Mention @everyone, @here, and All Roles.”</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This prevents raiders from being able to spam mentions to your entire server and/or particular channels. We recommend only granting this permission to people with roles you trust (e.g. Administrators, Moderators).</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10991042183447\" alt=\"raids101_3.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">3. <strong>Set up Raid Protection alerts. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; Safety Setup &gt; Raid Protection</strong></em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Raid Protection system provides protection from join-raids by using machine learning to evaluate various signals that are likely indicative of an upcoming raid and taking automated actions to safeguard your server.

At this time, availability may be limited.</h3>\n<p>4. <strong>Set a <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verification Level</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; Safety Setup &gt; Verification Level</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent raids on your Discord server, you can set a Verification Level in the Server Settings. Verification Levels require users to verify their email address or phone number before sending messages, which can help prevent bots and spam accounts from joining your server. We recommend setting the Verification Level to \"Low\" for basic security on public servers.</span></p>\n<p>5. <strong>Set your Explicit Media Content Filter to Medium or High. </strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; Safety Setup &gt; Explicit Media Content Filter</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raiders may often try to raid your server and post explicit content to shock, harass, or spur your members to leave. Enable this filter to automatically scan and block explicit media from being posted in your server. Community-enabled servers have the High Explicit Media Content filter on by default.</span></p>\n<p>6. <strong>Find and recruit moderators</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s always useful to have a moderator you trust online to immediately prevent or de-escalate a raid should one occur. </span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-49b3ece1-7fff-25e2-1578-7c868eaa3abf\">Our </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/community/identifying-assigning-moderators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Identifying and Assigning Moderators article</a> covers best practices you should know on finding and recruiting moderators.</p>\n<h1>Being raided? Here are ways to de-escalate the raid:</h1>\n<p>1.<strong> Pause invitations to your server.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; Invites &gt; Pause Invites</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prevent incoming raiders from joining your server through your invite links for as long as needed by pausing your invite links. Pausing invites to your server is a great means of crowd control if your server is being raided so you can tend to your server and de-escalate a raid without having to resort to drastic measures like deleting your invite links. You can unpause at any time.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<p>2. <strong>Enable </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952-Slowmode-Slllooowwwiiinng-down-your-channel\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\"><strong>Slowmode</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Right-click a channel or press the cog wheel next to the channel name &gt; Edit Channel &gt; Overview &gt; Slowmode</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If raiders have made their way in and are spamming large volumes of messages, turn on Slowmode to limit the number of messages they’re able to send in a channel based on a timed cooldown. This will help you reduce the chaos and make it easier for you to weed out bad actors.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<p>3. <strong>Adjust your AutoMod rules as needed. </strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; AutoMod </strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a raid, it’s important to identify the raiders, prevent them from posting in your server, and remove them as soon as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your server is being raided, consider fine-tuning your AutoMod rules as such:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add words or phrases you see raiders spamming to one of your Custom Rules, and turn on the “Block Message” response to prevent raiders’ messages from being posted. <br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify raiders and remove them by turning on “Send alerts” to receive alerts containing who-what-where information on raiders. <br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable the “Timeout member” response to temporarily disable a raider’s ability to send messages or join voice channels.</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on what raiders are doing, consider enabling the “Block Message,” “Send alerts” and “Timeout member” responses across all of your other AutoMod rules.</span></li>\n<li>Adjust your “Block Mention Spam” filter - Set a lower, more restrictive mention limit if raiders are spamming mentions in your server. Note that your mention limit means that members can’t exceed that number of <strong>unique</strong> mentions <em>per individual message</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.<strong> Increase your <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607-What-are-Verification-Levels-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verification to High or Highest</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Go to Server Settings &gt; Safety Setup &gt; Verification Level</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To strengthen the security of your Discord server during a raid, you can increase the Verification Level in the Server Settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher Verification Levels require users to verify their email address, phone number, and/or have been a member of the server for a certain amount of time before they can interact in the server. This can give you time to focus on de-escalating the raid without worrying about incoming raiders. Once the raid has been stopped, you can return your Verification Level to its prior settings.</span></p>\n<p>5.<strong> Report the raid to Discord</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Click on your server name to open the server dropdown menu &gt; Report Raid</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be our partner-in-crime (or against crime…?) in combating raids by reporting them directly to us from your server dropdown menu. If your Community is being raided, you can help us in our moderation efforts by reporting the situation as we’ll be regularly reviewing your raid reports to develop tooling designed to prevent future raids.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To use Report Raid, you must have “Ban Members” or “Kick Members” permissions. Only accessible on the Desktop client and in Community servers.</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10991093447191\" alt=\"raids101_4.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"514\"></span></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>"

Similar to modifying server roles, modifications to Linked Roles will immediately change access to Linked Roles-gated channels.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on how many Linked Roles can a channel have?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: At this time, there are no restrictions to how many Linked Roles a channel can have.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can Linked roles be created based on when a member joined Discord or when they joined the server?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: At this time, Linked Roles can not be created based on a user’s activity on Discord. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where can I see when a member has a Linked Role in the server?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Members who pass the checks for a Linked Role will not automatically show up in the role’s member list. Members will need to opt-in to the Linked Role by going to the Linked Roles tab under Server Settings, select the Linked Role of interest, and connect to the necessary accounts. This ensures that members actually want the role, rather than auto-assigning them.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I see how many members have verified themselves with Connections in server insights?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: At this time, no.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I allow one channel to check for one type of Linked Role and another channel with a different kind of Linked Role?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes! You can set up different Linked Roles per role. The role checks determine the Linked Role for entering the channel.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Which 3rd party App Connections are available today?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Jefit, Bloxlink, Solana, DeviantArt, Charlemagne, Captcha.bot</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will there be more connections available?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes! We are actively talking to many partners about making new connections available. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can developers build their own connections?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes, we opened up </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an API for all developers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to build any connection they want. With this, developers and admins can enable trust in their own individual communities and create Linked Roles based on these connections.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I set up Linked Roles on mobile?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: At this time, admins can not set up Linked roles on mobile.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do members get Linked Roles?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: At this time, the only way for a member to get a Linked Role is for you to go to the Linked Roles tab under Server Settings. They need to then click on the channel and pass checks in order to receive the Linked Role.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I see what the experience looks like for my members after I gate a channel on a Linked Role?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: As an admin, you automatically have access to all channels, regardless of role. Therefore, in order to view the experience as a normal member, you can either use an alt account or use the “view server as role” functionality and choose a role without admin permissions.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I have an existing role that I want to continue giving channel access to, but want to gate access to new members based on a Connection check?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: You can create a Linked Role, and add both roles to the channel (the existing role </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new Linked Role). All new members will see the Linked Role flow and need to verify, but existing role members will continue to get access. Members can also DM you for access and you can add them manually to the existing role, which will bypass the Linked Role.</span></p>\n<div id=\"gtx-trans\" style=\"position: absolute; left: 191px; top: 2069.14px;\">\n<div class=\"gtx-trans-icon\"> </div>\n</div>"

We are thrilled to introduce a new capture method for Windows user: <strong>Windows Graphics Capture</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Windows Graphics Capture</strong> is available on Windows 10 and above and is the latest Windows API to capture an application window.</p>\n<p>Discord uses multiple technologies to capture your screen. Our current default capture method uses similar technology to capture your screen that is used for overlay - \"<strong>Use our advanced technology to capture your screen</strong>\". Our signed DLL is injected into the application to extract rendered frames as they are being sent to Windows for display.</p>\n<p>On Windows 11 and higher, we will change the default capture method to Windows Graphics Capture. Unfortunately, it does not work for full screen exclusive (FSE) games.</p>\n<p>We use <code>SHQueryUserNotificationState</code> to determine whether the game is running in full screen exclusive mode. However, this method may give false positive and we fall back to other capture methods.</p>\n<h2>How do I check which capture method is used?</h2>\n<p>If you enable <strong>Developer Mode</strong> under Advanced User Settings, you can open Debug panel by clicking <strong>Voice/Video Connected</strong>.</p>\n<p>Under the <strong>Screen Share</strong> tab, Discord shows the number of frames captured for each screen share method.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/9410923159831\" alt=\"stats.png\"></p>\n<h2>How do I check whether the game is running in full screen exclusive mode?</h2>\n<p>Open <strong>Xbox Game Bar (Windows + G)</strong>. If the game minimizes, it uses FSE. If Xbox Game Bar renders smoothly on top of your game, it uses borderless fullscreen.</p>\n<p>Certain games offer to use the <strong>Full Screen</strong> or <strong>Borderless</strong> option. If the Full Screen option is selected, we may misclassify the game as using FSE and disable Windows Graphics Capture.</p>\n<p>If you would like to get the best screen share performance, please select the <strong>Borderless</strong> option.</p>"

When you go through the connection flow, you will see a modal which lists what information Discord is collecting from the account.

However, Connection </span><strong>details </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are only visible in the beta servers.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I change the visibility of my Connections?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: In your Connections user settings, select the Connection you want to modify and toggle off “display details on profile”. Other members of the server will still be able to see that you are verified with that Connection, but your personal information associated with that Connection will not be visible. You can also hide the connection completely by toggling off “display on profile”.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GDGVNQPH82F6Q10F6QACG6TE\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Setting up Connections</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need Nitro to have Connection details?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, your Nitro status does not impact your ability to add Connections or Connection details. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’ve added a payment provider account to Connections, but why am I still not being verified?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to your other payment provider account and confirm that you have a valid bank account on file as a form of payment. Having just a credit card or debit card on file will not qualify you for the “verified” status.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’m eligible for a role in my server, but I still don’t have access - how do I get access?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: If you have an eligible Connection which passes the requirements for the role, you’ll need to opt-in to the role by going to the gated channel in the server and clicking to join. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I set up my Connections if I’m on mobile?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A:  Currently as a user you can view your Connections and add Connections on mobile. However, you will need to be on desktop in order to opt-in for the role by going to the gated channel. You will only need to go through the desktop connection flow once to be granted the role, and then you can view the gated channel moving forward on mobile.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GK2KFYQ2JSMHCS6ZM4C3YVQ1\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Data transparency</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: What does Discord do with the personal account details that I add to Connections?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: We are storing this information to display on your profile and verify yourself for roles in servers. This information is stored securely within our databases, and will never be shared externally with third-parties without your explicit permission.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does Discord sell my data from Connections to third parties?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: No.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How often are Connections details refreshed?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Discord automatically refreshes the details from your Connections on a recurring basis. However, you can also force refresh by clicking “Refresh” in the Connections tab in User Settings.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’ve added my Steam account to Connections, but why don’t I see any of my game data?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Discord can only see your information that is public. If you want this information to be available in Discord, you need to go into your Steam account settings and make your profile public.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is visibility default on or off for Connections?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Visibility is default on for most Connections, except for Connections that tend to be associated with users’ real names (eg. Facebook, Spotify). You can update your visibility for Connections or Connection details in Settings &gt; Connections.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do my Connections or Connection details need to be visible in order to qualify for a role that checks Connection details?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: No. You can opt to hide your Connection or Connection details but still be eligible for any roles that require those Connection details.</span></p>\n<p> </p>"

Our </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> describes the information we collect, how we use and share it, and how you can control your information. This page describes how long we hold on to different types of information and why.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned in our Privacy Policy, we require the information that enables us to create your account, provide our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We retain personal information for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which we collected it. In general, this means that we retain your personal data for as long as you have an active Discord account. Some information you can delete directly from the services. We may also retain information for a certain period of time for specific purposes as described below. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As described in our Privacy Policy, you can limit Discord from collecting some types of information used for specific purposes. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information you can delete directly from the services</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may edit or erase content that you post within Discord. For example:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can edit or delete any message you have sent or content you have posted if you still have access to the space where you posted it.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can edit or delete a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can edit or delete a channel from a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you delete content, it will no longer be available to other users (though it may take some time to clear cached uploads). Deleted content will also be deleted from Discord’s systems, but we may retain content longer if we have a legal obligation to preserve it as described below.  Public posts may also be retained for 180 days to two years for use by Discord as described in our Privacy Policy (for example, to help us train models that proactively detect content that violates our policies). </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information retained until your account is deleted</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We keep some data for the life of your Discord account. This includes information about how you use Discord, which helps us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or how to improve our services. This also includes information like your username, email, and phone number. Some of that information may be kept for longer periods for specific purposes, as described below. You can </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212500837-How-do-I-permanently-delete-my-account-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delete your account at any time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and if your account is inactive for two years, we may delete it for you. For more on our deletion processes, see the “What happens when you delete your account” section below.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retention periods for specific purposes</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business and legal requirements may mean that we need to retain certain information for set periods of time, some of which may extend beyond the deletion of your account. For each type of information, we set these data retention periods based on the reason for its collection:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Age verification</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you submit an ID for an age verification appeal, we will delete it within sixty days after the age appeal ticket is closed. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Backups</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Our database backups are stored for 30-45 days upon which they are deleted.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Compliance with our legal obligations</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We may need to retain certain information for longer periods to comply with legal requirements. For example, when you purchase something through Discord, we need to retain information related to that transaction for  specific periods for tax and accounting purposes. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>To meet our safety and security commitments</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We retain certain information (including email addresses and phone numbers) for 180 days after deletion for trust and safety purposes. If a user has been reported or flagged for violations of our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines, we may retain this information for up to two years. This information helps us keep Discord secure, prevent fraud, or prevent bad actors from creating new accounts or otherwise engaging in behavior that violates our policies. <br></span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>To exercise or defend legal claims. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you contact Discord directly (such as for customer support inquiries and requests to access your information), we retain related information for five years from the closure of your request in case of a dispute or to exercise or defend our legal rights.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Continuity of our service</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you delete your account, we continue to retain and display the content you shared with other users, but that content is no longer tied to your account. We do this in order to ensure that other users continue to have access to the content shared with them. If you want to delete specific content, please do so before you delete your account. You can delete specific content as described in the “Information you can delete directly from the services” section above, or if you need help deleting content, you can write in to </span><a href=\"mailto:privacy@discord.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">privacy@discord.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens when you delete your account</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you delete your account, we will typically first put your account on hold for 15 to 30 days so that it can be recovered in case it was deleted unintentionally. Once that period expires, we begin the process of deleting identifying information and anonymizing or aggregating other information. Most of this happens quickly (unless the information is subject to a longer retention period as described above), but it can take up to 45 days to delete identifying information from backups. We retain aggregated and anonymized information, which is information that no longer enables us to identify you and is no longer tied to you as an individual. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your rights</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As provided in our </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, all our users have control over their information and can directly edit or delete information from their account and limit what data we process. If you are located in the European Union, the GDPR grants you the following specific rights that you can exercise through the Discord app directly or by contacting us:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right of access to your personal data</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to rectify your personal data if they are incorrect</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to erase your personal data</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to limit the processing of your personal data</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to the portability of your personal data</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to object to the processing of your personal data</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions about data retention or our deletion practices, or if you wish to exercise control over your information, please reach out to </span><a href=\"mailto:privacy@discord.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">privacy@discord.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>"

In the event of any conflict between these Monetization  Terms and any other Terms, these Monetization Terms will govern to the extent of such conflict. </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF0J7J49C9AG4A9HQ3E\">\n<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: <br></strong>The <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terms of Service</a> have a section titled “Settling Disputes Between You and Discord” that contains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver that applies to all U.S.-based Discord users. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court. </h3>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF0APEHGYSJEJ4QNQ9R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accepting the Terms</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By accepting these Monetization Terms, you agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. You also confirm and agree that you are at least 18 years of age and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country.  Please read all of the Terms carefully.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are accepting these Monetization Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Monetization Terms and by accepting these Monetization Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to \"you\" in the Monetization Terms refer to that entity).</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF0YE6AZ29FJ8JR907E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling things on Discord</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of this program, we allow certain users to sell things on Discord (an “Offering”). Offerings can include things like subscriptions to your server or content, access to certain perks or roles, one-time purchases, recurring subscriptions, and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord’s services include tools that make it easy to create and manage an Offering. You decide what you want to sell, you set the price, and you are responsible for providing the goods or services as described by you and for the period set by you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Server Subscriptions and other user monetization products are premium features available to certain qualifying users on Discord. We can choose who is eligible to sell things through our services at our discretion. We may include additional requirements or details directly in the services where you create a particular Offering, so please review those parts of our services carefully before creating an offering.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must accurately and fully describe your Offering, including what the user gets, the full price, any disclaimers or limitations about the Offering, and any rules or requirements (such as who is eligible) or other conditions that apply to users who purchase your Offering. Once they have purchased your Offering, you must provide users with what you offered them. If you materially change an existing Offering (for example by taking away perks), you must offer users who purchased the Offering a refund, or in the case of subscription, inform them of the changes and give them an opportunity to cancel or modify their subscription before the changes take effect. If we determine that you have not provided or are unable to provide users with the Offering they purchased, we may refund those users on your behalf. <br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must ensure that your Offering and any associated listing materials comply with all applicable laws, including advertising, marketing, consumer protection, gambling or sweepstakes, and data privacy and security laws, and do not contain any fraudulent, misleading, defamatory, or obscene materials. If you are selling age-restricted offerings, you must clearly identify that your offering is age-restricted. You must also verify that those who help provide or appear in your Offerings (including age-restricted content) are the age of majority, and where applicable, you must store their consent to participate. Discord may remove your Offering (including any associated content), indefinitely block or withhold payment, and/or terminate your account or community for violations of our Terms. See the “Restrictions” section below for more details.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord’s </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refund Policy</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the “Refund Policy”) applies to the sale of your Offering. You authorize Discord to determine a user’s eligibility for a refund under the Refund Policy in its sole discretion and to apply eligible refunds to a user’s account. You must provide a way for users who purchase your Offering to reach out to you to resolve disputes directly, and you (and not Discord) are responsible for resolving disputes that are not covered by the Refund Policy. Where you have been unable to resolve such a dispute and we determine that you have not provided or are unable to provide users with the Offering as described, we may provide a refund directly to users on your behalf. For any purchases made via mobile in-app purchases, you authorize the relevant mobile app store to determine refund eligibility and to issue eligible refunds directly to users.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re also always developing new features and products, and we may add or remove features, change who can use certain features, start offering new services, or stop offering old services. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your offering may not be accessible due to such outages or changes. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we are not liable for any such outages or service changes, including without limitation any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages, loss of profits, revenue, or data, or cost of cover.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF03S4MJXJRG8WVTXFG\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your relationship with Discord</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re an independent individual or entity (sometimes referred to as an independent contractor). You are not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Discord.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF0MBS10FKC4WP7434E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payments </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve created your Offering, users will be able to see and purchase it through your community. Discord provides users with access to the perks you provide directly through the services and allows users to pay for these offerings through Discord. Discord may assist you with managing payments issues such as fraud, chargebacks, and resolution of payments disputes with assistance from you.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All user payments for Offerings will be remitted to Discord through our authorized third-party payment gateways (each, a “Payment Gateway”). To be eligible to receive payouts, you’ll need to create an account with a third-party payout provider made available to you on Discord (“Payout Provider”). When you create an account with a Payout Provider, you may be entering into a direct relationship with that Payout Provider. If you will be entering into a direct relationship with the Payout Provider, we will present their applicable terms to you. Please review those terms closely. You will not be eligible to receive a payout until our Payout Provider has provisioned your account. Eligible payouts will be provided within forty five (45) days after the end of each calendar month. For example, for Offerings purchased in January, you will receive payouts within 45 days after January 31st. All payouts will be made via the payment method that you link through our Payout Provider. You can choose any payout currency offered by a Payout Provider, but the Payout Provider may charge a conversion fee. You must have a minimum balance of $100.00 to be eligible to receive your first payout, and a minimum balance of $25 for any subsequent payouts that you are eligible to receive. You can see payout status and other information in your Discord Server Settings by going to Payments under Premium Memberships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will be deemed to have accepted the accuracy of any payout from Discord hereunder unless you notify Discord of a dispute </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/requests/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by contacting us</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no later than 90 days after the date of the applicable payout from Discord to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your funds. We may also block or hold payouts for violations of our Terms (see “Restrictions” section below), for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting information, or if we anticipate a high volume of refunds or chargebacks on your Offerings. When payouts are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reason to you promptly. It is your responsibility to make sure that the contact information associated with your Discord account is up to date and that your bank account information is accurate. If you have questions about a payouts block, please </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/requests/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reach out to us</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In order to protect you, we may block users’ payments if we believe them to be fraudulent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes activities like refunds or chargebacks will mean that you owe money to Discord in excess of the amount we have agreed to pay out to you. You agree that we may off-set or discount, as applicable, any amounts owed to Discord against future payments owed to you or collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. You authorize Discord to use any of these methods to recover any amounts owed to Discord. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a User initiates a chargeback in connection with the purchase of an Offering, you agree to provide timely information to Discord to assist in any chargeback investigation. You understand that the failure to provide information on the requested timeline could adversely impact the outcome of a chargeback investigation, up to complete forfeiture of the chargeback amounts. You are solely responsible for any forfeited chargeback amounts, chargeback fees, payments or fines imposed by credit and debit card networks or other payment method providers that arise out of your conduct or your Offering.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appointment of Discord as a payment collection agent</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Discord acts as your payment collection agent solely for the limited purpose of accepting and processing payments from users purchasing your Offering. Because Discord acts as your payment collection agent, you understand that payment made by a user through Discord will be considered the same as a payment made directly to you, and you will provide the offering in the agreed-upon manner as if you received the payment directly from the user. You also agree that we may refund users in accordance with our </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339366295\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paid Services Terms</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refund Policy</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You understand that Discord is only obliged to pay you when it successfully receives the payment from a user who purchases your Offering. Discord guarantees payments to you only for amounts that have been successfully received by Discord from users. In accepting an appointment as your limited payment collection agent, Discord assumes no liability for any acts or omissions made by you.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF04KNRB4YKHX39CVFS\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fees</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will deduct fees for each purchase of an Offering as summarized in the categories below (collectively, the “Fees”). Fees will be calculated based on the transaction type at the rate set out in Schedule 1 of these Monetization Terms. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Payment processing fees</strong>, which are the fees charged by Payment Gateways or mobile app stores we use to process purchases of your Offering by users on Discord and make associated payouts to you (“Payment Processing Fees”). Payment Processing Fees are calculated as a percentage of the total purchase price paid by a user. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Additional transaction fees</strong> such as currency conversion fees and other fees applied by Payment Gateways, mobile app stores, banks, or other entities for the processing of any transactions related to an Offering, including payouts, fraud, or refunds (“Transaction Fees”). Transaction Fees will be calculated according to the method used by the third party applying the fee and will be charged to you as applicable.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Platform fee</strong> payable to Discord, which is the fee we charge for making monetization products available to you (“Platform Fee”). The Platform Fee is calculated as a percentage of total payments from a user less applicable Payment Processing Fees and Transaction Fees.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For purchases made by users through the Discord mobile app, you direct us to increase the total price of your Offering to account for any Payment Processing Fees charged by mobile app stores. Any additional amounts collected as a result of this price increase will be used to pay for the Payment Processing Fees charged by a mobile app store. We may offer you the option to modify this setting, in which case we will present you with specific terms in the services or in communications with you outlining any applicable fee or pricing changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to applicable Fees, we may also deduct refunds, chargebacks, and associated fees from your payout as described in these terms. Your bank, our Payout Provider, or a Payment Gateway may also charge currency conversion or foreign transaction fees. We do not control currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your bank, our Payout Provider, or a Payment Gateway and those fees may be deducted from your payout.<br></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF091FYTG86TB8WD81A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We or our Payout Provider may collect tax identification information and report this to tax authorities as legally required. You are responsible for reporting any income or withholding taxes which may be due as a result of payments received, and you are responsible for paying all taxes, fees, duties, and other governmental charges, and any related interest, arising from payments made to you by Discord. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also authorize us to receive any required tax reporting or documentation directly from Payout Providers on your behalf. Where required, we will make any tax reporting documentation that we receive on your behalf available to you promptly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord reserves the right to assess applicable taxes as required by local law or by our Payment Gateways, including applicable sales taxes for the purchase of any Offering. Depending on your location, you may be charged transaction taxes (sales, VAT, GST, withholding, and other similar taxes). </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9KAAQF06HX0E85T0E9S39BN\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restrictions</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot sell (or do) anything on Discord that violates our Terms or any applicable laws, rules, or regulations.

Members will also receive updates on new features or updates directly from Discord. We also use the community as a way to gather feedback on some features and ask members to provide us with feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where can I find the rules for the server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Current rules can be found in the #rules channel. Be sure to read them completely!</p>\n<p>However, Discord reserves the right to act on misbehavior and violations not explicitly listed in our rules. At all times, use common sense and good judgment for anything you do on the server. Moderation actions by Staff or Moderators will ensure that we continue to promote healthy communities and assume that all Admins will be acting with positive intent.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I'm in the server, but I can't see any channels! What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You must complete our Community Onboarding to access channels in the server. If you are still struggling with this, you can message our Modmail bot and ask a moderator for assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Manage Server is a pretty high permission to give out, why is it locked behind this?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We want to ensure that we are reaching server owners, admins and moderators with this community. As such, this will require us to ensure we are reaching an audience that has this permission or capability in order to create a welcoming and fun community for all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>"

When we talk about off-platform behaviors, we’re referring to any behaviors taking place outside of Discord, either in other digital spaces or in a physical community.

This is an important step in the development of our rules governing user content and behaviors. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new guideline states that users </span><strong>may not share false or misleading information on Discord that is likely to cause physical or societal harm </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— including content that could result in damage to physical infrastructure, injury to others, the obstruction of participation in civic processes, or that could endanger the public health.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We would like to dive a bit deeper into the rule against health misinformation. Ensuring the accuracy of online health information has never been as important as during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is our hope that this new rule will be an effective countermeasure against dangerous medical-related falsehoods — both during the pandemic and after its conclusion.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overview of the Policy</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early days of COVID-19 demonstrated our collective need for rigorous medical science from trustworthy sources. The personal health choices made during this time had the potential to impact communities and the world. False or misleading health information continues today to have potential to cause harm: It can prompt individuals to make unsafe choices; it can obscure important information about diseases; and it can lead to undermining of public health protocols. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do not allow individuals on Discord to </span><strong>post, promote, or organize communities around false or misleading health information that is likely to result in harm</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This includes:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-vaccination content; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medically unsupported and dangerous cures for disease; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content that distorts information about a disease; and,</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any content that could hinder the resolution of a public health emergency.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We consider health information “false or misleading” if it directly and unequivocally contradicts the most recent consensus reached by the medical community. Our standard for actioning </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">requires</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the content be likely to cause some form of harm. A non-exhaustive list of potential harms includes: heightening risk of exposure to a transmissible disease; causing undue strain on public health systems; and inciting panic or social unrest with conspiratorial health claims.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord users also may not post or promote content that </span><strong>attempts to sway opinion through the use of sensationalized, alarmist, or hyperbolic language</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or any content that </span><strong>repeats widely-debunked health claims, unsubstantiated rumors, or conspiratorial narratives.</strong></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Criteria for Actioning and Exceptions</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will take action against individuals, small groups, and servers that post, promote, or organize around content that makes false or misleading claims about any of the following:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the safety, side effects, or efficacy of vaccines;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ingredients, development, or approval of vaccines;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative, unapproved treatments for disease (including claims that promote harmful forms of self-medication, as well as claims advocating vaccine refusal or alternatives);</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the existence or prevalence of a disease;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the transmission or symptoms of a disease;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health guidance, advisories, or mandates (including false claims about preventative measures and actions that could hinder the resolution of a public health emergency);</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the availability or eligibility for health services; and,</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content that implies a health conspiracy by malicious forces (including claims that could cause social unrest or prompt the destruction of critical infrastructure).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This policy is </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> intended to be punitive of polarizing or controversial viewpoints. We allow the sharing of </span><strong>personal health experiences</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; </span><strong>opinions and commentary</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (so long as such views are based in fact and will not lead to harm); </span><strong>good-faith discussions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about medical science and research; content intended to </span><strong>condemn or debunk</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> health misinformation; and </span><strong>satire and humor</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that obviously and deliberately intends to mock false or misleading health claims.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enforcing This Policy</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We determine the severity of a violation by weighing four main factors: the </span><strong>gravity of the harm likely to result</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the content; the poster’s </span><strong>intent to convince</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> others that the false or misleading information is true; the poster’s </span><strong>apparent intent to deceive</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> others into believing the misinformation; and whether the poster or group has had </span><strong>repeated violations of this policy</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may take any number of enforcement actions in response to violations of this policy — including warning an account, server, or entire moderator team; temporarily suspending an account; removing harmful content; and permanently suspending an account or server. </span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking Ahead</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital misinformation is harmful because it hinders people’s ability to come to well-reasoned conclusions — and it does so at a rate faster than what is possible with in-person dialogue. Seeing the rise of incomplete, incorrect, or misleading online health information during the COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly concerning. We want to continue to ensure that this content does not spread on our platform even after the world rebuilds from the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We encourage users to </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">report harmful misinformation</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to our Trust &amp; Safety team. The full list of content and behaviors not allowed on Discord can be found in our </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/safety\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety Center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://discord.com/category/safety\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Policy &amp; Safety Blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are also great resources if you would like to read more about our approach to content moderation. Please check back on our blog in the coming months for additional posts about our efforts to combat the spread of misinformation. We are excited to share even more updates about our work in this important and timely area.</span></p>"

We made changes so that it’s easier for you to follow along.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Better description of our services.</strong> We added in more details on how Discord works – from how users communicate to how activities are shared.

    "body": "<p> </p>\n<p>Effective: March 27, 2023</p>\n<p>Last Updated: February 24, 2023</p>\n<p>Thank you for buying something through Discord! These Paid Services Terms apply to anything bought or sold using Discord’s supported purchase flows and supplement our<a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Terms of Service</a>. You may also be asked to agree to separate terms before accessing paid products or services. If you are under 18 (or the legal age of majority in your place of residence), you need your parent’s or guardian’s permission to make purchases through Discord.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use of paid services: We use third-party payment processors to transmit payments to us. By providing a payment method to us, you agree that (i) you are authorized to use the payment method you provide; (ii) you will in fact pay for the paid service by the date on which payment is due; (iii) the payment information you provide is true and accurate; (iv) we may retain the payment information and method that you and the issuer of your payment method or the applicable payment network submit to us; and (v) we are authorized to charge you for the paid service using the payment method you present. This includes any obligation you may have to pay any taxes applicable to the service you are buying. You also agree that we have permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and our payment processors (including any institutions or processors we retain in the future) information regarding your purchase and your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase and to use the contact information (such as an email address or phone number) submitted by you to provide you with notices and disclosures relating to renewals, recurring charges, and changes affecting your purchase.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Payment methods<em>. </em>Discord accepts certain payment methods. These may vary by country or paid service and may change from time to time. You can update your payment methods in the “Billing” section of the Settings page in your Discord account. Please note that Discord is not responsible for any fees or charges applied by your financial institution or payment method issuer related to our processing of your payment. In some cases, we may allow you to pay against an invoice. Invoices will be sent to the email address associated with your account, and we will invoice you no more than forty-five (45) days after the purchase of the relevant service. All amounts invoiced are due and payable within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified on the invoice itself. All amounts are payable in United States dollars unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Virtual goods. You may be able to purchase virtual goods from Discord through our services. If you do so, you’ll have a limited, personal, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to use your purchased virtual goods solely within our services and solely in conjunction with the Discord account through which you purchased them. Your license to use virtual goods cannot be sold, traded, transferred, exchanged, or used outside of your Discord account. You do not own, or have any other right, title, or other proprietary interest in these virtual goods, regardless of any consideration offered or paid in exchange. In fact, the license to those virtual goods is really a software license to access and use the software that enables your access to the virtual goods. Virtual goods are not property and have no cash value. We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any virtual goods, or terminate provision of virtual goods at any time, in our sole discretion, without any liability to you. The license you receive to use virtual goods terminates when your Discord account is deleted or terminated and may be terminated, in Discord’s sole discretion, if you violate the Discord Terms of Service or any other applicable policy. Additionally, if your account is suspended, your access to virtual goods may be suspended or terminated. We will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you, and we have no liability to you or to any third party associated with the loss of such virtual goods.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Subscriptions. We may allow you to purchase subscriptions to premium features and content. These subscriptions may be sold by Discord or others (see the section on “Stuff sold by others” below for more). Subscriptions purchased through Discord and associated subscription fees are available on the “Subscriptions” section of the Settings page in your Discord account. You will find details about the subscriptions you’ve purchased from Discord, the applicable subscription fee, and the next payment due date there as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Billing</em>. We’ll automatically bill you starting on the date you first purchase your subscription (or whenever your payment method is successfully charged), and on each periodic renewal date (monthly, annually, or other renewal period) until cancellation (see “Cancellation” below for more information on how to cancel a subscription). By initiating your first subscription fee payment, you authorize us to charge your payment method for recurring subscription fees on an ongoing basis. For annual subscriptions, we’ll send you a reminder of the then-current subscription fee at least 30 days, and at most 60 days, in advance of your automatic renewal, or as otherwise required by applicable law. Some states and countries have mandatory laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph does not override those laws. UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US OF YOUR DESIRE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE “CANCELLATION” SECTION BELOW), YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE AMOUNT OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY APPLICABLE TAXES ON EACH PERIODIC RENEWAL DATE.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Price changes</em>. We may, from time to time, change the price for subscriptions, but we’ll give you advance notice of such changes and their effective date either via our services (such as the Discord system direct message) or to the contact information associated with your Discord account (or both). Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use or otherwise receive the benefits of the subscription service after the price change effective date. You may also reject the price change by canceling your subscription.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Cancellation</em>. You may cancel your subscriptions at any time by going to the “Subscriptions” or “Server Boosts” section of your Settings page. In-app subscription purchases made on iOS or Android devices can be canceled directly through the iOS App Store or Google Play. Following cancellation, you’ll continue to have access to premium features through the end of the current subscription period. We may cancel any subscription you have purchased if you fail to pay the applicable subscription fees and any applicable taxes in full and in a timely manner according to these Terms. If your payment is not successful (for example, if your payment method expired or has insufficient funds), we may attempt to re-run your payment method. We will also try to provide you notice of the failed payment and the opportunity to make a valid, on time payment to us, but we are not obligated to do so. In the event you fail to pay us, your subscription may be canceled or suspended. We may, in our sole discretion, choose not to cancel a subscription immediately for non-payment, in which case you will continue to be responsible for the fees due for the duration of the applicable subscription. In addition, if you fail to pay for a subscription, we may suspend your rights to use that premium service or we may change the type of privileges you have to a non-paid version of the service. Your subscription may also be terminated, in Discord’s sole discretion, if you violate the Discord Terms of Service or other published policies. If your Discord account is terminated, your subscription will be automatically canceled.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Experimental features. </em>We may, from time to time, test experimental features to help us improve Discord. When we do this, we’ll label these features as beta features or similarly indicate that they are experimental features that may be subject to change or removal. You should not rely on these experimental features when deciding to purchase a premium subscription from Discord, as we may modify or remove them at our discretion.</li>\n<li>We may decide to stop offering subscriptions at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, or to comply with a legal requirement; if so, we’ll cancel your subscription and refund the prorated portion of any prepaid subscription fee equal to the remaining unused term of the subscription.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stuff sold by others. We may allow you to purchase subscriptions or other things offered by other sellers on Discord. Depending on the offering you are purchasing, you may transact directly with the seller via an accepted payment method, or with Discord in its capacity as payment collection agent for the purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the seller. In all cases, these sellers are responsible for describing and providing these offerings, not Discord. We do not control the quality of these offerings, and we cannot guarantee the identity of the people providing them or the validity of any claims they make. If you identify subscriptions or other offerings on our services that violate our policies, please report them to us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Promotions. We may occasionally offer promotions on paid services. The specific terms of each promotion will be stated at the time the promotion is offered. If you receive a discount, use a coupon code, or subscribe during a free trial or other promotion, your subscription will automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the end of the promotional period. You must cancel the subscription prior to the end of the promotional period in order to avoid incurring further charges. After renewal, you may cancel your subscription at any time as described in the “Cancellation” section above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gifts. You may be able to purchase and “gift” various products to other users, including subscriptions. Gifts may only be redeemed through Discord by clicking the gift link shared with you or by entering the gift code in the “Gift Inventory” section of the Settings page. There are no fees to access or utilize a gift, but for a gift subscription, you may be required to enter a payment method when you redeem it. Once redeemed and activated, the code is void and cannot be transferred or assigned to any other user. A gift subscription is good for the particular service and term set forth in the redemption flow when you enter the code. At the end of that term, your subscription will automatically be renewed using the payment method provided when you redeemed the gift. Recipients of gift subscriptions may cancel their subscription at any time following activation, but the recipient is not entitled to a refund or credit of any kind in the event of such cancellation. Gift subscriptions may not be redeemed for cash or combined with other promotional offers, free trial offers, or incentives, except as required by law. Gift subscription codes do not expire, so please keep your gift subscription code in a safe location. We are not responsible for lost or stolen redemption codes or the unauthorized redemption of gift subscriptions, except as required by law.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Taxes and fees.

To help ensure that communities and people are safer, we've created guidelines to help servers understand what is and isn't allowed if you choose to make your community open to everyone. Having the ability to reach more people on Discord is a big privilege which means that there is some additional responsibility for each server owner and their moderation team.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Abide by the Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</strong> This means that issues reported to your server should be addressed by your moderators and admins. Your moderator team should know when to escalate issues to Trust &amp; Safety.

Our Trust &amp; Safety team will investigate spaces that are reported to us or that we proactively identify as likely in violation of our policies, and Trust &amp; Safety team members may temporarily join these spaces to investigate potential violations.</li>\n<li>We may remove an affiliated server or account from one or more means of discovery if the server or account recently violated our Community Guidelines and received an enforcement action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Foster a healthy and positive environment.</strong> People should feel welcome in your server and its affiliated spaces. Create environments where people want to spend time with each other, share interests, participate in community events, and build friendships. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No content or behavior meant to <strong>single-out, bully, or harass users and/or other communities. This includes off-platform spaces as well.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>No discussions about <strong>controlled substances or drugs</strong>. This may get you reported to law enforcement.</li>\n<li>No servers dedicated to use of regulated goods, such as alcohol.</li>\n<li>Do not cultivate general toxic behavior or other derogatory content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Do not host graphic or sexual content.</strong> Graphic violence and sexual content are not allowed in public spaces. Servers opting into any publicly viewable feature should be appropriate for audiences of all ages 13+.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Have a server name and description that accurately describes the server that is free of profanity.</strong> Help potential members understand why they want to join the server, conversations, and activities taking place.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Respect people's intellectual property and other rights.</strong> Only incorporate content that you own or have a license to use. Do not invade anyone's privacy, libel them, or otherwise violate their rights.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Have a moderator team.</strong> Moderators can help ensure nothing rule-breaking is happening in your server and its public spaces and can find meaningful ways for your members to engage. Build a moderator team that members of your community can trust and turn to for help.</p>\n<p><strong>We may consider off-platform behavior when assessing an account or server for violation of Discovery guidelines.</strong></p>"

    "body": "<p>Stages are a new way to connect you and your community to the things that everyone is passionate about in a more personal way — whether it be a specific video game, an artist, a hobby, or topics like if Yoda really knew about Order 66 beforehand. We want to expand these opportunities to allow our communities to let new users find these spaces, which means we're here to help provide some guidance into some of the best ways to use these spaces and what is not allowed.</p>\n<h1>Note to Server Owners and Moderators</h1>\n<p>Since Stages will be spaces that exist within your server, server owners and stage moderators are responsible and accountable for the Stages being held. We empower and equip our communities to have the tools to help them properly ensure that these spaces are not engaging in any violations and are kept safe and welcoming. Stages are extensions of your server and activity that happens within them will be representative of your server. You'll have the ability to make your stage available only to members of your server or open to anyone on Discord. Public Stages have some different features and must follow additional requirements as described below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stage-guidelines\">Stage Guidelines:</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Abide by the Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</strong> This means that issues reported to your server should be addressed by your moderators and admins. Your moderator team should know when to escalate issues to Trust &amp; Safety. Servers that violate <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">Discord's Community Guidelines</a> and <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">Terms of Service</a> will be subject to further action from our Trust &amp; Safety Team.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We want Discord to be a safe, positive, and inclusive experience. Our Trust &amp; Safety team will investigate Stages that are reported to us or that we proactively identify as likely in violation of our policies, and Trust &amp; Safety team members may temporarily join a live Stage to investigate potential violations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Respect people's intellectual property and other rights.</strong> Only incorporate content that you own or have a license to use. Do not invade anyone's privacy, libel them, or otherwise violate their rights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Discord does not currently provide a recording or transcript feature. If you choose to use third-party tools to record or transcribe your event, you must make sure that you are following relevant laws, including getting consent from speakers and audience members if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Foster a healthy and positive environment.</strong> People should feel welcome in your Stage. Create environments where people want to spend time with each other, share interests, participate in community events, and build friendships. Do not cultivate general toxic behavior, harassment of others, or other derogatory content.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Have a moderator team.</strong> Moderators can help ensure nothing rule-breaking is happening during your Stage events and can find meaningful ways for your members to engage. Build a moderator team that members of your community can trust and turn to for help. Note: Moderators will help facilitate your conversations in your Stage and should help enforce your server-specific rules as well!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Have a topic and description that accurately describes the Stage that is free of profanity.</strong> Help potential members understand why they want to join the Stage. The Stage title and description should accurately reflect the nature of the event, and not mislead users about who will be speaking or what will be discussed.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Do not host e</strong><strong>xplicit, graphic, or sexual content. </strong>Explicit and age-restricted content is not allowed in Stages. Stages should be appropriate for audiences of all ages 13+.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Public Stages: Be mindful anyone can join your server while your public Stage is live. </strong>Though these Stages are extensions of your community, when you opt-in to make your Stage public, you are also temporarily making your server public while the event is live. This means that you should make sure that any and all sensitive channels are marked private and have the appropriate roles and permissions set up.</p>"

A server’s various roles can be identified by color, which defaults to applying a color to your username, or server nickname, based on your highest sitting role of that server.

As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play League but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>\n<p>For more information about Activities on Discord, go <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>!</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: What is Poker Night?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: Poker Night is a Texas hold 'em style game with up to 7 other players.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you must be at least 18 years old to launch or play Poker Night.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels.

    "body": "<p>Recently, we've had to make a policy change which restricts users under 16 from verifying their bots on Discord alone. We created this article to explain what verification is and how you can help a young developer verify their bot and continue to grow their software, whether you're a parent, a friend, a guardian, or otherwise.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-is-a-verified-bot\">What is a verified bot?</h1>\n<p>At Discord, we want to foster unique communities where users can make a special space online that feels like theirs and theirs alone. Our API and developer tools allow developers both aspiring and established to contribute to those communities and craft awesome software that people can use to make their Discord server feels like home. To foster that creativity and keep our users safe, we launched a verification program, which asks developers operating bots of a certain scale to submit their bot for identity verification and general review.</p>\n<h2 id=\"which-bots-qualify-for-verification\">Which bots qualify for verification?</h2>\n<p>Bots begin qualifying for verification once they're in 76 servers or more. Bots are required to be verified in order to join over 100 servers. Qualifying developers will receive a direct message on Discord informing them when their bot is ready for verification.</p>\n<h3>More information on the verification process is available <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412-Bot-Verification-and-Data-Whitelisting\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</h3>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-requirements-for-verification-whats-changing\">What are the requirements for verification? What's changing?</h2>\n<p>Any verified bot will be asked to submit a qualifying identity document and a comprehensive form asking for details about their bot's operation. We want to ensure that developers operating software at scale are real and trustworthy, and that we know more about how their software works on our platform.</p>\n<p>Previously, qualifying identity documents could come from any user who was of age to use Discord in their region, as documented <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday-\" target=\"_self\">here</a>. However, due to some legal concerns on behalf of our identity verification partners at Stripe, we've had to make a policy change regarding the age of verified developers. As of <strong>April 12th, 2021</strong>, only the identity documents of those <strong>16 and older</strong> will qualify for verification, regardless of region.</p>\n<h3>We've posted a comprehensive article on these changes <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006788822\" target=\"_self\">here</a>, and we encourage you to review that article for more information on the new verification age policy.</h3>\n<h1 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-developers-under-16\">What does this mean for developers under 16?</h1>\n<p>This policy change means that users under 16 can no longer verify their bots on their own, even if they're old enough to use Discord in their region. We want to ensure that young developers are able to foster a lifelong love of programming through their work on Discord, and so we've encouraged these developers to work with a qualifying partner to help them get verified. This can be anyone a young developer would trust to help them make cool stuff—a friend, a co-developer, a programming teacher, or a parent or legal guardian. As long as you are 16 or older, and are willing to speak on the developer's behalf and work with them going forward, you can help a young developer verify.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-do-i-help-a-developer-under-16-verify-their-bot\">How do I help a developer under 16 verify their bot?</h1>\n<p>To help a developer under 16 verify their bot, you'll need to first create a Discord account. You can learn how to create your own Discord account <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Once your account is created, work with the bot's developer to complete the following steps!</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-developer-team\">Creating a Developer Team</h2>\n<p>First, the bot needing verification will need to be part of a Developer Team so its ownership can be split among multiple users and can be easily transferred between people.</p>\n<p>To do this, the bot's developer will visit the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/\" target=\"_self\">Discord Developer Portal</a> and create a Developer Team using the Teams tab. From that new team's page, the developer can then add anyone they would like to their new team, including your account, by typing the relevant username and four-digit discriminator into the invite field. You'll then need to check your account email for an invite message and accept the team invite to proceed.</p>\n<p>Once the Team has been created and you've been added to it, the developer will transfer their bot to that new team from the bot's page in the Applications tab using the Transfer App to Team button in the bottom right of the page.</p>\n<p>Finally, the developer will want to transfer their Developer Team's ownership to you using the Transfer Team Ownership button on the team's page in the Teams tab.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applying-for-verification\">Applying for Verification</h2>\n<p>Now that you're the owner of the Developer Team, you can begin the application process to verify the bot! With the bot's developer on hand, visit the Applications tab in the sidebar, then select the bot in question and click the verification link at the top of the page.</p>\n<h4 id=\"submitting-an-id\"><strong>Submitting an ID</strong></h4>\n<p>First, you'll need to submit your identity to our partners at Stripe. This can be done from a PC or a mobile device. You'll want to take a well-lit, unobstructed, and unedited picture of your identity document for submission.</p>\n<p>Stripe is an established processor of payments and identity information, and we've trusted them for years with identity verification and payments for our subscription services like Nitro and server boosts. They accept a wide variety of identity documents! Many of them are listed in their documentation <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/acceptable-verification-documents\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you're unsure whether your identity document is accepted, you can contact our Support Team at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://dis.gd/contact</a>, or ask in the Discord Developers server at https://discord.gg/discord-developers</p>\n<h4 id=\"filling-the-form\"><strong>Filling the Form</strong></h4>\n<p>Once your ID has been verified by Stripe, you'll return to the Developer Portal and fill out the relevant form. You'll want to work with the bot's developer to fill out this form and provide the best possible answers! If the developer isn't sure how to answer a question, they can read more about the verification process here, or they can join our Developers server to get answers from both our staff and from other verified developers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"waiting-for-review\"><strong>Waiting for Review</strong></h4>\n<p>Once the form is submitted, a ticket is created with our verification team. Verification applications are typically reviewed within 4-5 business days, though the wait time can occasionally vary based on the current number of applications.</p>\n<p>When our team has an update on the verification status, be it an approval, a question, or a denial, you'll receive an email at the address tied to your Discord account. You can also reference your account's tickets by logging in on our support page <a href=\"https://dis.gd/mytickets\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure to work with the bot's developer to review the email our team sends you. These often have important information or questions that require answers to proceed, so please make sure they're there to see the email with you!</p>\n<p>If you have concerns about a specific verification in process, feel free to visit our Developers server at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://discord.gg/discord-developers</a> to ask a staff member for more information!</p>\n<h4 id=\"after-verification\"><strong>After Verification</strong></h4>\n<p>Once a bot is finally verified, you'll need to remain the owner of the team and bot. The developer who you're assisting can be added to the Team for any future maintenance or changes. If we have questions or concerns about the bot's operation at any time, we'll send them to the email address associated with the team's current owner.</p>\n<h1 id=\"why-do-you-need-an-id\">Why do you need an ID?</h1>\n<p>Our partners at Stripe review identification documents during the verification process so we can ensure those operating bots at scale are real individuals who can be accountable for their bot's operation. This helps us foster an innovative and unique developer ecosystem while keeping our users safe from bad actors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-handles-my-information\">Who handles my information?</h2>\n<p>Our partners at Stripe act as our identity verification provider. Stripe is legally and contractually obligated to only use the data in a way that we’ve approved, which is to provide the service of identity verification. The data still comes from Discord and still belongs to Discord, and so we have the right and ability to remove that data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-can-see-my-information\">Who can see my information?</h2>\n<p>A small number of Discord employees (as in, fewer than ten) who are involved in security and legal will be able to access the information. The information is not stored on Discord itself and is not generally accessible to employees outside of this group. We understand that this is highly sensitive, and access to the information is not something that we take lightly. It is expressly for the use case of bad, bad actors. We’re not talking about general Trust and Safety concerns, like spambots or a bot deleting channels in a server. Instead, we’re looking to prevent data breaches, wide-scale privacy violations, and illegal activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-you-delete-my-id\">Can you delete my ID?</h2>\n<p>We can only delete your verification data after your verified bot is deleted. Removing information upon demand defeats the purpose of verifying identity. At the same time, we have no interest in keeping this data longer than we need to, and we want to balance those two principles. As such, our retention policy is that we'll remove the identification information a year after the bot that it is connected with has been deleted.</p>\n<p>This is in line with industry-standard retention guidelines for anti-abuse and anti-fraud situations. Keeping information after bot deletion for some amount of time is absolutely necessary — as we know in the security world, some misdeeds don't come to light immediately, and we want to make sure that we can take the steps to keep users safe.</p>\n<p>In case you're curious about the legal front, use of data for this purpose is outlined both in the GDPR (see Recital 47), as well as the CCPA (Cal Civ Code § 1798.105(d)(2)).</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-censor-part-of-my-id\">Can I censor part of my ID?</h2>\n<p>We need to see your complete and unedited ID in order to verify your identity. Keep in mind that we accept a variety of identity documents, some of which contain less information than others, so you can always consider using one of the alternative options. If you're ever uncertain, please contact us at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://dis.gd/contact</a> and we'd be happy to help further.</p>\n<h4 id=\"im-in-the-netherlands-what-about-kopie-id\"><strong>I'm in the Netherlands. What about KopieID?</strong></h4>\n<p>Our partners at Stripe fully comply with KopieID recommendations, and we can process IDs that are edited using the official KopieID app. You can download that app here: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"i-have-additional-questions\">I have additional questions!</h2>\n<p>If you have any additional questions about the verification process, we're here to help. Questions regarding data processing, data retention, supported documentation, or anything else can be submitted to our support team at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://dis.gd/contact</a>. You can also share them in our Developers server at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://discord.gg/discord-developers</a>.</p>"

In most cases, this will allow MacOS to present the necessary authorization prompt again. Follow these steps:</p>\n<p>1. Quit System Preferences and Discord</p>\n<p>2. In the Finder, select the <span class=\"uielement\">Go to Folder…</span> command from the <span class=\"uielement\">Go</span> menu.</p>\n<p>3. In the folder field, enter the following location:<br><code>/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/</code></p>\n<p>4. Press the <span class=\"uielement\">Go</span> button. In the window which appears, you'll see a <code>ACE.driver</code> folder.</p>\n<p>5. Select that folder, and move it to the Trash.</p>\n<p>6. Confirm this action in the Finder when prompted.</p>\n<p>7. Restart your Mac.</p>\n<p>8. Run Discord and visit your Voice &amp; Video settings to install the sound capture extension.</p>\n<p>If the above steps do not cause the authorization prompt to appear properly, you can follow the next set of steps to manually authorize ACE.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-orange110\"><strong>Authorizing ACE manually</strong></span></p>\n<p>If MacOS still fails to show the correct prompt to authorize our ACE component for use, you’ll need to manually authorize it. This is done by entering the Mac's Recovery mode.</p>\n<p>1. To enter the Mac's Recovery mode, follow Apple's instructions for <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-macos-recovery-on-an-intel-based-mac-mchl338cf9a8/11.0/mac/11.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intel</a> or for <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/macos-recovery-a-mac-apple-silicon-mchl82829c17/11.0/mac/11.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Silicon</a>.</p>\n<p>2. Once booted into Recovery, open the Terminal utility there and enter the following commands:</p>\n<pre>spctl kext-consent disable\nspctl kext-consent add 7266XEXAPM\nspctl kext-consent enable</pre>\n<p>3. After entering those commands, restart your Mac. Launch Discord again, and you'll be able to proceed through the installation.</p>\n<p>Once ACE is properly authorized and installed, you’ll be all set for the future: future updates to the component can be installed, or it can be uninstalled and even reinstalled, without requiring any further system-level authorization.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H9TTWYH7S9FBR0JF1B210SBW\">Need More Support? </h1>\n<p>If you've attempted the setup steps above and still have trouble sharing sound with your streams, please reach out to our team over at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://dis.gd/contact</a>.</p>"

No more guessing how commands work or trying to figure out which ID goes where. Slash Commands are here to make your life a whole lot easier.</p>\n<h1>WHAT ARE SLASH COMMANDS?</h1>\n<p>Slash Commands are the new, exciting way to build and interact with bots on Discord. With Slash Commands, all you have to do is type <code>/</code> and you're ready to use your favorite bot. You can easily see all the commands a bot has, and validation and error handling help you get the command right the first time.</p>\n<p>Not every bot might be using Slash Commands right now. They're brand new, and it'll take some time for developers to start using them. So, be patient, but get excited!</p>\n<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>\n<p>We've all used a <code>!help</code> command and then received a wall of text in response. Now, instead of having to google a bot's commands or look through that long <code>!help</code> answer, you can see all the commands a bot has to offer just by typing <code>/</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003352961/mceclip2.png\" alt=\"mceclip2.png\"></p>\n<p>This command list will filter commands as you type, making it easy to browse commands or find exactly what you're looking for. You quick typers out there can also use <code>TAB</code> and <code>ENTER</code> to quickly choose and navigate through commands.</p>\n<h1>AUTOCOMPLETE</h1>\n<p>For certain values in Slash Commands, we'll help you out with a handy autocomplete! No more needing to remember ids. If you need to pick a user, a role, or a channel, you can use the autocomplete that you know and love to help.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360102174634/mceclip0.png\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\"></p>\n<h1>VALIDATION AND ERROR HANDLING</h1>\n<p>Slash Commands help you learn how to use bots without the awkward mistakes of typing the wrong command into chat, or typing it the wrong way. If you accidentally pick an invalid option, we'll let you know before it sends:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360104339433/mceclip1.png\" alt=\"mceclip1.png\"></p>\n<h1>NEW PERMISSIONS</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003297542/mceclip3.png\" alt=\"mceclip3.png\"></p>\n<p>Slash Commands are powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility. So, we've added a new \"Use Slash Commands\" permission to help keep your server organized. You can turn off Slash Commands for your entire server or for a specific channel by changing that permission.</p>\n<p>The \"Use Slash Commands\" permission only affects commands created by bots. \"Built-in\" commands like <code>/giphy</code>, <code>/nick</code>, and <code>/me</code> will be unaffected.</p>\n<h1>HOW DO I MAKE SLASH COMMANDS?</h1>\n<p>If you want to try your hand at making custom Slash Commands, check out our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands\" target=\"_self\">documentation.</a> Slash Commands can be integrated into your existing bot, or you can make something entirely new!</p>"

As the server you followed continues to post announcements, you'll receive posts from that server in the channel you picked. </p>\n<p>The posts will come from a bot named after the server in question. All the links and images in the post will be delivered as you'd expect, but our delivery bots will remove any and all role mentions in the post, including @everyone and @here.</p>\n<h3>Keep in mind, server admins have the ability to choose which announcement posts will be published and sent to your server through Channel Following.

If you want to stop receiving posts from a server that you followed, it's easy! Any servers you follow are added to your server as a Webhook. To unfollow a server, look for the server's listing in Server Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Channels Followed:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360097223094/remove.png\" alt=\"remove.png\"></p>\n<p>Delete the bot that corresponds with that server's name to unfollow it!

If you don't see the plan type that you want to purchase you can still go on the desktop or browser app and purchase that plan through that platform. You will still be able to use the benefits on your Android device if you purchase through desktop.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I already bought a subscription that I use on Android. Does this change anything about that?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're happy with your current subscription, you don't need to change anything! However, moving forward any changes you want to make to that subscription will need to be done through the desktop/browser app.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I currently have a subscription on desktop, but want to move it to manage it through the Google Play store. How do I do that?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can cancel your subscription on desktop and then re-subscribe through the Android app. However, make sure that you wait until the end of your current billing period to sign back up on Android. </p>\n<p>Please note if you cancel your subscription on Android you will either have to sign up for Google Play or sign back up on desktop, but manage your subscription through desktop only. If you cancel your desktop subscription and re-sign up on desktop later you will also lose your streak. The only way to maintain your streak is to continue with your desktop subscription or sign up to Google Play within 7 days of the original desktop subscription ending.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will I lose my streak if I switch my subscription over to Google Play?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you re-subscribe within 7 days after your desktop subscription ends to a subscription within Google Play your Nitro streak will transfer over and not be lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can't I do certain gifting actions through Google Play?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Currently, you can purchase and send gifts through Google Play. If you have a desktop subscription you will be able to redeem, apply, and send gifts through your Android app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HA2EPVX1VG6JP5PG1KDEBB89\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Note:<br></span><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">- Currently, gifts purchased through Google Play cannot contribute towards subscriptions managed by the Google Play Store. <br></span><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">- Redeemed gifts can still contribute towards subscriptions purchased on our desktop or browser apps.</span>\n</h3>\n<p>If you're on the Android app, and you already have a Google Play subscription and you redeem a gift purchased through the Google Play store, your redeemed Nitro gift will not contribute towards that subscription and it will become Account Credit that can be used for a subscription on our desktop or browser app!</p>\n<p>If you're on the Android app, and you have no active subscription when you redeem a gift purchased through the Google Play store, you will begin a subscription that can be managed on the desktop or browser app! </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can't I create a subscription through Google Play when I already created one on my Android device?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can only have one active platform subscription at a time. If you previously created a subscription on your Android device you currently have a desktop subscription that will need to be managed through your desktop or browser app.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I currently have a subscription through iOS can I manage that subscription on my Android phone?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you currently have a subscription through iOS you will not be able to purchase, cancel, or otherwise manage your subscription on an Android device.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens when I upgrade or downgrade a subscription in Google Play?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Similar to a desktop subscription your upgrade will be immediate and the price will be pro-rated. Downgrades will occur at the next billing cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I tried to upgrade my subscription and add onto my current subscription, but it got swapped to another subscription instead! Why did my subscription get swapped instead of upgraded? </strong></p>\n<p>A: Please note that subscription plans on Google Play cannot be added to each other and you will only be able to switch between plans.</p>\n<p>If you wish to upgrade your subscription, you will need to switch to the plan that includes all of the subscriptions you wish to purchase.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>If you currently have a Nitro Basic subscription, and you would like to update your subscription to include 2 Server Boost subscriptions as well, you will then need to manually select the \"Nitro Basic + 2 Server Boost\" subscription plan.</p>\n<p>If you currently have a Nitro Basic subscription, and you select to purchase the \"2 Server Boost\" subscription plan, your Nitro Basic subscription will be removed, and you will only have an active subscription for 2 Server Boosts.</p>"

This means that Partner requirements will now primarily focus on the success of your Discord server rather than your performance on other platforms.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>What perks do I get for being accepted to the Partner Program? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon acceptance, you’ll receive the following server and user perks: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vanity URL</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Server Invite Splash Images </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Server Banners</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animated Server Icon</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 384kbps voice bitrate </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fancy Partner server badge</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fancy Partner profile badge for the owner</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Discord Nitro for the server owner</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you transfer your Partnered server, you are opting in to also transfer your personal perks, including your Partner profile badge, and your free access to Discord Nitro.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Server Insights says my server is “actively growing.” What's that mean?</strong></span></p>\n<p>We consider a server “actively growing” if it is gaining at least 20 new members on average a week. We do our best to not include users who intend to spam or raid your server. <br><br>You do not need to be actively growing to apply for Partnership. If you aren’t gaining at least 20 members a week, then your User Retention will not be checked with our requirements.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying for the Discord Partner Program</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Can I apply for the Partner Program without a server? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nope – owning a server that qualifies for Partnership is a hard requirement. We don’t accept applications through email, or servers that are just getting started. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Am I guaranteed Partnership if I hit the requirements to apply?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We consider our Partnership requirements the minimum requirements before applying. Your server will still be reviewed by our team after you submit an application. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Our community would like to apply, but the owner is inactive or doesn’t want to apply. Can we apply on their behalf?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only the server owner can apply for Partnership. If the server owner isn’t around or willing to apply, you will not be able to apply for the Partner Program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the server owner has been inactive for an extended period of time, you may want to look into requesting a manual server transfer from our support team. You can reach out to them at </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047513451-Partner-Program-Mega-FAQ-\" target=\"_self\">dis.gd/contact</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>I represent a creator and I own their server. Can I apply for Partnership?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No - if the server you’re applying for is based upon the work of a content creator, then we prefer that the content creator is the one owning the server and applying.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Do I still get a physical swag for gaining Partnership?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With our new requirements potentially opening up the program to many more Partners, we’re looking into the logistics behind sending so many hoodies.<br><br>No news to share about physical merch yet, but we’ll have more info to share soon. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining Your Partnership </span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>When I get accepted as a Partner, is it mine to keep forever? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as you maintain our engagement requirements, you can stay Partnered. If you aren’t consistently reaching our requirements for 8 weeks in a row, you may be at risk of removal from the program. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\" style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>I’m already a Partner, but I haven’t reached requirements in a few weeks. What will happen to me? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"> Any active Partnered server at risk of removal will be given a total of two months, or 8 weeks, to bring their partnered servers back in line with our requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">However, we will not remove Partners without ample warning. After 4 weeks of not reaching our Partnership requirements, you’ll receive a notice in your email inbox giving you a heads up. If you don’t reach requirements for the full 8 weeks, you will receive a final notice informing you of your removal from the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">You can always track your server’s progress towards Partnership, at any time, in Server Insights.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">I got removed from the Partner Program. Is this permanent? </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all! If you leave the Partner Program due to inactivity, then build your community back up to our engagement requirements, you are more than welcome to reapply. </span></p>\n<p> </p>"

For the main differences between the two, here’s the lowdown:</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Verified Server? </span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verified Servers are communities run by businesses, brands, and figures of public interest. When you see a Verified badge, you’ll know you’re in the official home for that brand, person or any other subject matter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acceptance for Server Verification grants your server access to a Vanity URL, invite splash background, and the Verified Server badge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own the server of a well-known business, brand, or you’re a public figure with a strong following, you may qualify for verification. Check out our Verified Server Requirements article before applying.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s a Discord Partner? </span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Discord Partner Program is designed to reward </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quality, engaged servers with recognition and extra tools to help them invest in their community. If you see a Partner badge next to the server’s name, you know it’s one of the best communities out there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acceptance for the Discord Partner Program includes both a Vanity URL and an invite splash, along with a Server Banner and animated Server Icon, a Discord Partner badge for both the server and the server owner, and the owner gets Discord Nitro, on the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone can apply for the Partner Program, but you’ll need to hit some requirements before being able to apply.

For example, if a server is both Partnered and Verified and loses Partnership, it can stay Verified and retain any perks that are tied to being a Verified Server. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the perks that come with each program, here’s the lowdown on what each one gets:</span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 403px;\" width=\"731\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><strong>Perk</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><strong>Verified Servers</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><strong>Partner Program</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vanity URL</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invite Splash </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">384kbps Voice</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">Lottie Files for Custom Stickers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animated Server Icon</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Server Banner</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord Nitro for Owner</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verified badge on Server</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 280px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partner badge on Server</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 202.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 212.5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important thing to note: If you’re part of both programs, your Verification badge will override the Discord Partner badge visually.

You can use webhooks and Channel Following to get news and updates from other Discord servers and the internet at large posted directly into your server. For those of us that stream or make videos on YouTube and Twitch, our integrations with those platforms help you personalize your Discord server for your fans and subscribers.</p>\n<p>All of these things contributed to making your Discord server uniquely yours. They make it feel like home for your friends and community. And now, they all live in one place to see and manage!</p>\n<p>Meet the Server Integrations Page</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/338006709224210442/735252240561864704/unknown.png\"></p>\n<h1>What is it?</h1>\n<p>The Integrations page is a place to manage all the bots, webhooks, and other apps that you add to your server to make it your own. For streamers and content creators, it's also the place to manage your Twitch and YouTube integrations. Let's dive into the specifics of each section.</p>\n<h1>Webhooks</h1>\n<p>Webhooks are a simple way to post messages from other apps and websites into Discord using internet magic. You can learn about all the specifics in our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks\" target=\"_self\">Intro to Webhooks</a> help article.</p>\n<p>The webhook page lets you see all the webhooks that have been added to your server, who added them and when, and what channel they post to. You can create new webhooks, as well as edit existing ones by changing their name, avatar, or channel. You can copy their URL for use in your code, or delete them if you're done using them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360062609871/mceclip2.png\" alt=\"mceclip2.png\"></p>\n<h1>Channel Following</h1>\n<p>You can now see all the channels your server is following in one place. <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028384531-Channel-Following-FAQ\" target=\"_self\">Channel Following</a> allows you to follow announcements channels in other Discord servers into your own. Whenever a message is sent in those channels, it'll be posted directly into your server.</p>\n<p>On this page, you can see all the channels you're following, edit their names and avatars, change where they post, or remove them if you no longer wish to get updates from that server.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360062609511/mceclip1.png\" alt=\"mceclip1.png\"></p>\n<h1>Twitch and YouTube</h1>\n<p>If you're a streamer, your integration management has also received a facelift! All of the functionality that previously existed is still there, as well as new info that wasn't shown to you before like who added a given YouTube or Twitch account to the server.</p>\n<p>For specifics on how these integrations work, check out the help articles for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212112068-Twitch-Integration-FAQ\" target=\"_self\">Twitch Integration FAQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215162978-Youtube-Channel-Memberships-Integration-FAQ\" target=\"_self\">YouTube Channel Membership Integration FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360064714771/mceclip0.png\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360062609111/mceclip0.png\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\"></p>\n<h1>Bots and Apps</h1>\n<p>And now for something totally new! For the first time, the bots and apps that you've added to your server have their own home in Discord. You can see a list of everything that's been added to your server, when it was added, and who added them.</p>\n<p>You can also click into an individual bot or app and see the permissions it requested when it joined the server. Any webhooks that belong to the bot or app will also show up on this page, and can be managed just like other webhooks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/338006709224210442/735242181706776657/unknown.png\"></p>\n<p>We want to continue to make bots and apps an awesome experience on Discord, because we know how important they are to all of you! We're excited that they finally have a home in Discord, and you should continue to be excited for more things to come on this page!</p>"

You’ll first notice that we got rid of the drawer and moved to <em>sliding panels</em>. This opened the door for us to implement a couple of better gestures:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can swipe from any area on the screen to navigate between panels. Much easier on the thumbs than reaching for the edge of the screen to open a drawer.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can now \"peek\" at a new activity without having to leave your current chat. Less time navigating and more time chatting.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360056281571/2_panel_gestures_Food_with_Friends.gif\" alt=\"2_panel_gestures_Food_with_Friends.gif\" width=\"487\" height=\"869\"></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_f4f9a5fa-6683-4640-8c00-1733e839386c\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved access to features</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you'll notice the new bottom tabs. We wanted to find a way to expose important features in a more mobile-native way.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Home tab</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Discord is where friends and communities come together, so we made the main Home tab front-and-center. Your servers and DMs live here.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360056341611/3_static_picture_of_first_chats_tab.png\" alt=\"3_static_picture_of_first_chats_tab.png\" width=\"516\" height=\"917\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">\n<strong>Friends tab</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: We know real estate is a precious commodity on mobile devices, and tabs allowed us to remove the Friends page from being buried in the DM list. Previously, it could take up to 5 gestures to accept a friend request (open drawer → tap the home button → tap friends → tap the old “Pending” tab → tap accept). Now with tabs and some improvements to the friends page, it will only take 3. And it can have its own notification badges so you won’t miss a new request.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360056186532/4_friend_request_tabs_demo.gif\" alt=\"4_friend_request_tabs_demo.gif\" width=\"526\" height=\"936\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Quick Switcher and Recent Mentions</strong>: To our users who are a part of many communities, we built the Quick Switcher and Recent Mentions features to make it easier to navigate around and find messages relevant to you. When we rolled out experiments with giving these features their own space, we noticed that the use of the Quick Switcher nearly doubled! We’ll be making improvements to these experiences as well -- stay tuned!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360056341711/5_quick_switcher_demo_with_more_servers.gif\" alt=\"5_quick_switcher_demo_with_more_servers.gif\" width=\"539\" height=\"961\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>User Settings</strong>: Your own user settings can be accessed on the right-most tab that displays your avatar and status. Power-user of custom statuses? No problem -- you can still change them directly from the tabs view by long-pressing the User Settings tab.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360056186572/6_settings_tab_click_and_long_press.gif\" alt=\"6_settings_tab_click_and_long_press.gif\" width=\"542\" height=\"964\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we’re excited about the power of tabs, we also wanted to keep the app uncluttered, especially while you're in a conversation. So we decided that you should only see the tabs when you need them. The tabs will slide them away when you’re viewing a channel or DM.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360056186592/7_opening_and_closing_tabs.gif\" alt=\"7_opening_and_closing_tabs.gif\" width=\"546\" height=\"974\"></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_1a84813d-5802-43bf-bbf9-7ac6c77929ae\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Future</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, tabs give us the flexibility to keep investing in making Discord more useful to our users. As an example, millions of users on the desktop have used server discovery to find communities relevant to their interests. In a post-tabs world, we now have a few options to bring a better way to discover new servers to mobile without cluttering the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As always, we’re constantly looking for ways to improve. Let us know if you have any <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feedback</a>!</span></p>"

(Mic, Camera, Notifications, etc)</strong><br>A: Since your permissions are only tied to the domain name discordapp.com, you will now need to allow permissions to our new domain <a class=\"textEditor-link\" href=\"https://discord.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-is-link=\"https://Discord.com\">discord.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why did all of my customizations to my account get reset (ex: Frequently Used emoji, notification settings, etc)? </strong><br>A: Our team has done their best to make sure that your customized Discord settings will not be impacted. However, some users may have been automatically logged out of their account during the update process.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, if you were automatically logged out of your account with this domain update, your customizations to your account may have also been removed as well and will need to be added once more.</p>\n<p>We're so sorry for the confusion and frustration with those reset customizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why are my images/icons not appearing or loading?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It's possible that a browser add-on, extension, or ad blocker setting is blocking Discord from loading images.</p>\n<p>Double check any settings with your browser add-ons, extensions, or ad blockers, and make sure that discord.com has all the necessary permissions in order to have these images load again.</p>\n<p>You may also need to <span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">allowlist </span> cdn.discordapp.com as well in your browser add-ons settings.</p>"

    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve been telling us stories of how you’re using Discord in all sorts of amazing ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve seen classrooms come together, workers without an office find a new place to connect, and tons of surprising uses. To help out where we can, we recently </span><a href=\"https://blog.discordapp.com/helping-out-where-we-can-3a5fb7bac77a\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that we’re temporarily raising the user limit on Go Live from 10 to 50 people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main reasons we made this change was to help teachers. With high schools and college campuses closing in many parts of the world, more and more of them are turning to Discord to make sure their students don’t fall behind and can continue to learn. And we’ve been flooded with requests from educators asking: What can I do with Discord?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it briefly, Discord offers:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dedicated, free to use, invite only class space for classes like AP US History</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Text channels to organize things like lessons, homework, or study groups so students can go over the latest Pre-Calculus assignments together</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voice channels for both one-to-one and group discussions, or even office hours</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A real-time teaching environment where lessons can be shared with up to 50 people at a time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re an educator, you might be new to Discord. We created a fast, one-click way to get you started.</span><strong> Just </strong><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/template/fVfBazbqjhXg\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong> and you’ll breeze through the Discord signup and automatically get your own pre-organized classroom space.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve also pulled together an overview of how to use Discord for online learning. Please note that the minimum age to join Discord is 13, so younger students won’t be able to use the service.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Discord 101</strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can download and sign up for Discord for free on </span><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/download\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">desktop</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord/id985746746\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iOS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Android</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or via your </span><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/register\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web browser</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

As you explore, you’ll see it offers almost limitless options for customization and organization, so you can make your classroom space exactly as you want.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s inspiring to see dedicated teachers doing everything they can to keep educating. While we hope schools can be reopened as soon as possible, we’ll do whatever we can to help in the meantime.

Krisp is able to remove background noise much better than traditional solutions, letting you have clear conversations even in busy environments!</p>\n<p>Krisp is also a stand alone app. You can learn more about their company and software specifically on their website <a href=\"https://api.krisp.ai/v2/resource/link/discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does Krisp do on Discord?</strong></h2>\n<p>We’ve integrated Krisp to improve our voice call experience even further. By toggling on Krisp we use machine learning to remove background noises that aren’t human voices such as dogs barking, vacuums, or doors slamming while still passing through your voice.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do I turn it on?</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>\n<p>You’re able to toggle on this new noise suppression feature in any voice or video chat by clicking the noise suppression button <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360063199831/supression.png\" alt=\"supression.png\" width=\"21\" height=\"21\"><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">.

This means that no voice, user, video or any data is ever sent or shared outside of Discord. The machine learning model runs on your device to cancel out noise - no data is ever sent to Krisp's servers under any circumstances.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional Frequently asked questions</span></h1>\n<p><strong>Q: How much does it cost? <br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Krisp is free when you use it with Discord. If you want to use it outside of Discord in other apps, you can check out their pricing <a href=\"https://api.krisp.ai/v2/resource/link/discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will Krisp filter noises for other people on the call when I have it on?<br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: No. Krisp will only filter noises coming from your side. So if your friends do not have it toggled on you may still hear their background noise. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: When should I use Krisp?<br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Krisp works best in environments where there is a lot of non-human voice background noise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Krisp works to process out background noises if you are in a quiet environment and have a high-quality mic you may notice a decline in voice quality. If you’re in a quiet environment where you don’t need noise filtration we would encourage you to continue using voice chat without Krisp. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use Krisp on video calls?<br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes! Krisp can also be used on audio for video calls as well.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will Krisp work for Go Live?<br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes! Krisp can be used when you are using the voice channel in Go-Live stream. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does Krisp work on mobile?<br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: As of 7/27/20 Krisp will be available on mobile devices</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I toggle on Krisp in one voice chat will it toggle on in all other voice chats?<br></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes. Once you toggle on Krisp it will be active for any new voice chats until you toggle it back off again.</span></p>"

If you want to know more about the future of bots coming this year, you should definitely read our blog post: <a href=\"https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e\" target=\"_self\">The Future of Bots on Discord</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What this article covers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_46b3869c-6d50-43fc-b07c-9ed7569a1160\" target=\"_self\">Verification</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#how-do-i-start-the-process\" target=\"_self\">How do I start the process?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-long-does-it-take-to-get-verified\" target=\"_self\">How long does it take to get verified?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-if-im-already-in-100-guilds\" target=\"_self\">What if I'm already in 100 <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">servers</span>?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#privileged-intent-whitelisting\" target=\"_self\">Privileged Intent Allowlisting</a><br>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-if-im-already-in-100-guilds-1\" target=\"_self\">What if I'm already in 100 <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">server</span>s?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-do-i-get-whitelisted\" target=\"_self\">How do I get allowlisted?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-long-does-it-take-to-get-whitelisted\" target=\"_self\">How long does it take to get allowlisted?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-considered-an-acceptable-use-case\" target=\"_self\">What is considered an acceptable use case?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_f5d10e6a-4ceb-4578-94c9-3359e7d5f12d\" target=\"_self\">Stripe Data FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_46b3869c-6d50-43fc-b07c-9ed7569a1160\">Verification</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Verification is a big step in the world of Discord bots. It’s the secure foundation we need to unlock new features and visibility for developers.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Verification means that we can release features that give developers more control over Discord. It means we can encourage users to adopt bots within Discord, instead of scouring the internet. It also means that bots can safely grow orders of magnitude larger than they are today. Protecting user privacy and security, as well as maintaining trust, is our utmost responsibility. We want to ensure that we continue to uphold that as our bot ecosystem grows.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Therefore, we are making verification a requirement for bots in 100 or more servers. Until your bot is verified, you will not be able to grow past 100 servers. If your bot is already in more than 100 servers, it will not be able to join any more.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">We recognize that this is a big change, so we’re instituting a 6 month deprecation period ending on <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">October 7, 2020 </strong>to get everyone verified that meets the criteria. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Until that date, no restrictions will be enforced.</strong></p>\n<p>After being verified, your bot will receive a Verified check mark, to show it's legit!</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1mdZEoRc0awxyjFR\" alt=\"Image of a verified bot badge, which is a check mark inside the current Bot badge\" data-image-id=\"0*1mdZEoRc0awxyjFR\" data-width=\"1210\" data-height=\"918\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-start-the-process\">How do I start the process?</h2>\n<p>Head on over to your bot's settings page in the Developer Portal. At the top of that page will be a banner with instructions on how to get started. This process is currently available for bots in more than 75 <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">servers</span>, to allow developers to preemptively apply.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-long-does-it-take-to-get-verified\">How long does it take to get verified?</h2>\n<p>Once you submit a verification request, a human will look at your submission and get back to you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">From now until the deadline of October 7, 2020, <strong>while no limits are being enforced</strong>, we will strive for a five business day turnaround time for all verification requests. During this time period, we will evaluate our process to ensure that we can commit to faster turnaround times after the deprecation period has ended. Please be mindful of the influx of verification requests that we will receive during the initial roll-out.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-if-im-already-in-100-guilds\">What if I'm already in 100 servers?</h2>\n<p>If your bot is already in 100 <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">servers</span>, you have until October 7, 2020 to go through our verification process. After that date, if you have not been verified, your bot will not be able <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">to join any new servers.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"privileged-intent-whitelisting\">Privileged Intent Allowlisting</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">As part of the verification process, we’re including an opt-in process to get allowlisted for <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener\" data-href=\"https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents\">Privileged Gateway Intents</a>. We believe that allowlisting access to certain information at scale, as well as requiring verification to reach that scale, will be a big positive step towards combating bad actors and continuing to uphold the privacy and safety of Discord users.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Again, this only applies to bots in 100 or more servers. You may start the process as early as 76 servers, and you have until <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">October 7, 2020</strong> to complete it before limitations are enforced.</p>\n<p>You must apply for allowlisting if you turn on any of the Privileged Intents for your bots in the Developer Portal like so and your bot is in 100 or more servers:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360054322951\" alt=\"intents.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-if-im-already-in-100-guilds-1\">What if I am already in 100 <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">servers</span>?</h2>\n<p>If you're already in 100 <span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">servers </span>and want to enable Privileged Intents for your bot, you may do so from now until <strong>October 7, 2020</strong> and get allowlisted after turning them on.</p>\n<p>After our deprecation period ends<strong>,</strong> if your bot is in over 100 servers, you cannot turn on Privileged Intents until you get allowlisted first. We don't want you to have broken bots, so please get allowlisted first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-whitelisted\">How do I get allowlisted?</h2>\n<p><span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">At the top of your bot settings page, you should see a button to begin the process if your bot is in more than 75 servers. </span>If you don't see that and believe you should, please <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_self\">reach out to us via support</a>.</p>\n<p>When you click that button, you'll be redirected to a questionnaire. We'll ask you a few questions including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which Intents you're applying for</li>\n<li>Your use case for those Intents</li>\n<li>Some data security and privacy questions</li>\n<li>The ability to edit your verification request, if you have already submitted one, with new information regarding your new needs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-long-does-it-take-to-get-whitelisted\">How long does it take to get allowlisted?</h2>\n<p>Once you submit an application, a human will look at your submission and get back to you.</p>\n<p>From now until the deadline of October 7, 2020, <strong>while no limits are being enforced</strong>, we will strive for a five-business-day turnaround time for all verification requests. During this time period, we will evaluate our process to ensure that we can commit to faster turnaround times after the deprecation period has ended. Please be mindful of the influx of verification requests that we will receive during the initial roll-out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-considered-an-acceptable-use-case\">What is considered an acceptable use case?</h2>\n<p>We're glad you asked! (And, we know this was the big question on your mind). As with most things, it is up to the details of the implementation. Rather than list out every possible idea, or have you extrapolate on examples, here are some principles that guide the way we think.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about your particular use case, be as descriptive as possible in your application, and please feel free to <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_self\">reach out to our support team</a>, or talk to us in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\" target=\"_self\">Discord Server</a>! We're happy to talk you through the process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01H7XFQMC8REQ8XEVNMPM41QSP\">Meet User Expectations</h3>\n<p>In general, a good principle of privacy is to ask yourself \"Would someone be surprised by this?\" If the answer isn't solidly \"no\", it might be worth evaluating.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01H7XFQMC85M9JA19G5NEAYD8Z\">Practice Principles of Least Privilege</h3>\n<p>The principles of least privilege state that you should only be asking for privileges that you fundamentally need. The Discord API is pretty vast, and there may be a better way to go about what you're trying to do. We'd love to have that conversation with you and help you think it through!</p>\n<h3 id=\"01H7XFQMC88XR4D8Y27AYM2NS3\">Be Sensitive to What Info You Have</h3>\n<p>Info from Discord comes in many shapes and sizes, and you have a large responsibility to be sensitive to what info you're getting and storing, especially with data from Privileged Intents. If you're using data that is fully anonymous and aggregated, ensure that access to that data is limited to only those who should be able to see it, be that in the context of your development team or privileges in a server.<br><br>If you're using information about individuals, make sure you really take user expectations to heart, and provide users with a way to request deletion of that data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01H7XFQMC81KV64Y4Q4HYYB08E\">Be Sensitive to Who Has Access</h3>\n<p>Discord Servers are often private places. Even in public servers, though they're welcome for everyone to join, people have a sense that what they're doing is in <em>that</em> community, and not mirrored or copied somewhere else. Be mindful of who on your team has access to information, as well as under what privileges you show users access to it. For example, data about a specific server--even anonymous and aggregated--should probably be limited in access to just people <em>in </em>that server with proper permissions.</p>\n<p>We know this was a lot. If you have any questions about the process or requirements, please feel free to get in touch with us over at <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dis.gd/contact</a>, or come see us in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\" target=\"_self\"><span class=\"sentiment-comment-neutral\">Discord Server</span></a>! We want to help and ensure all of this is as painless as possible. Thank you for your hard work in helping keep Discord a safe place for everyone, and we can't wait to see your creation flourish!</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_f5d10e6a-4ceb-4578-94c9-3359e7d5f12d\">Stripe Data FAQ</h1>\n<div id=\"703359005963059331\" class=\"message-2qnXI6 cozyMessage-3V1Y8y groupStart-23k01U wrapper-2a6GCs cozy-3raOZG zalgo-jN1Ica\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-setsize=\"66\" aria-posinset=\"53\" data-ref-id=\"messages-52\">\n<div class=\"contents-2mQqc9\">\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"><strong>What's the relationship between Stripe and Discord?</strong></div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">Stripe acts as our identity verification provider, and is legally and contractually obligated to only use the data in a way that we’ve approved, which is to provide the service of identity verification. The data still comes from Discord and still belongs to Discord, and so we have the right and ability to remove that data. Essentially, they’re providing a service to us like Google or Cloudflare does.</div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"> </div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"><strong>Who can access the information I submit?</strong></div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">A small number of employees (as in, fewer than ten) who are involved in security and legal will be able to access the information. The information is not stored on Discord itself and is not generally accessible to employees outside of this group. We understand that this is highly sensitive, and access to the information is not something that we take lightly. It is expressly for the use case of bad, bad actors. We’re not talking about general Trust and Safety concerns, like spambots or a bot deleting channels in a server. Instead, we’re looking to prevent data breaches, wide-scale privacy violations, and illegal activity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buttonContainer-DHceWr\">\n<div class=\"buttons-cl5qTG container-3npvBV isHeader-2dII4U\" aria-label=\"Message Actions\">\n<div class=\"wrapper-2aW0bm\">\n<div class=\"button-1ZiXG9\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Add Reaction\" aria-controls=\"popout_17533\" aria-expanded=\"false\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"703359050901094511\" class=\"message-2qnXI6 cozyMessage-3V1Y8y wrapper-2a6GCs cozy-3raOZG zalgo-jN1Ica\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-setsize=\"66\" aria-posinset=\"54\" data-ref-id=\"messages-53\">\n<div class=\"contents-2mQqc9\">\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"><strong>Why are you doing this, again?</strong></div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">Discord is a platform where hundreds of millions of people talk to each other on a daily basis about everything going on in their lives. Keeping that information secure is one of our top priorities. We spend a lot of time hardening the security of our internal databases and procedures, but we also want to make sure that access to data through the API is also handled responsibly and thoughtfully. This includes proactive measures, like this verification process, proper authentication and limits on our APIs, and stipulations in our Developer Terms of Service, like the mandate that End-User data is encrypted at rest.</div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"> </div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">As such, verification accomplishes two goals: it serves as a barrier to growth to bad actors in the first place, and it is also a method to act on them if they are to get through that barrier.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"buttonContainer-DHceWr\">\n<div class=\"buttons-cl5qTG container-3npvBV\" aria-label=\"Message Actions\">\n<div class=\"wrapper-2aW0bm\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"703359139530801253\" class=\"message-2qnXI6 cozyMessage-3V1Y8y wrapper-2a6GCs cozy-3raOZG zalgo-jN1Ica\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-setsize=\"66\" aria-posinset=\"55\" data-ref-id=\"messages-54\">\n<div class=\"contents-2mQqc9\">\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"><strong>How can I delete the information I’ve submitted?</strong></div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">Removing information upon demand defeats the purpose of verifying identity. At the same time, we have no interest in keeping this data longer than we need to, and we want to balance those two principles. As such, our retention policy is that we'll remove the identification information a year after the bot that it is connected with has been deleted.</div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"> </div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">This is in line with industry-standard retention guidelines for anti-abuse and anti-fraud situations. Keeping information after bot deletion for some amount of time is absolutely necessary — as we know in the security world, some misdeeds don't come to light immediately, and we want to make sure that we can take the steps to keep users safe.</div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"> </div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\"><strong>Legal Nerd Hat</strong></div>\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC\">In case you're curious about the legal front, use of data for this purpose is outlined both in the GDPR (see Recital 47), as well as the CCPA (Cal Civ Code § 1798.105(d)(2)).</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

When using an audio interface, while your audio will be picked up and shared with other users, you may experience temporary choppiness or a cutting in-and-out of your audio input. Unfortunately, while this WebRTC bug is present, we cannot offer troubleshooting steps to avoid these issues at this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we may offer compatibility with audio interfaces and XLR devices on macOS in the future, because this bug is not Discord-specific, we sadly can't offer an ETA for when this issue will be fixed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're an audio interface user on macOS and you'd like to use voice chat on Discord, we would advise using a traditional headset or microphone rather than the use of a dedicated audio interface for the most consistent audio performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We support a variety of audio devices including Bluetooth wireless devices, 3.5mm AUX jack devices, and USB audio devices, and we regret being unable to fully support audio interfaces and XLR devices at the current time. </span></p>\n<h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions or concerns about what audio devices we support, or you run into an issue with a device that isn't an audio interface, please let us know either</span><a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">directly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or via </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/discord\" target=\"_self\">Twitter</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!</span>\n</h3>"

Bad actors like these use a couple methods for scraping user data from our site: harvesting server information from server widgets (which is a server-configurable option in the server settings) and creating automated user accounts, called \"self-bots\", to join as many servers as possible through proxy manipulation.</p>\n<p>Self-bots are and have always been a violation of our <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API Terms of Use</a>, and we have implemented a number of methods to detect this kind of abuse. Additionally, we have made several recent changes to limit the ability of bad actors to abuse our API in this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We've anonymized and limited data returned on server widgets</li>\n<li>We've added stricter rate limits to widget data and to profile data</li>\n<li>We've added stricter permission requirements and other limitations to downloading member list as an ordinary user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes have helped limit mass gathering of new information by known bad actors, and our engineers will continue to improve our ability to prevent these bad actors from creating new accounts in the future. On top of that work, we have a dedicated team working on a new service, scheduled for launch in the near future, to help us even better detect this kind of abuse on our platform.</p>\n<p>We care deeply about maintaining and protecting the privacy of all of our users, and we're always here to answer your questions.

Scan it and you'll see!</em></p>\n<p>To scan the login code, head to the Discord app. Open the User Settings menu, then choose the Scan QR Code option! We'll ask for camera permissions if you haven't granted them to us already, then you're ready to scan! Once the scanner's open, simply line up the box with the QR code on screen.</p>\n<h3>You can also scan the QR code using any application that supports QR scanning, including the Camera app on many devices! You'll get a quick shortcut to the Discord app for final scanning and approval.</h3>\n<h1 id=\"logging-in\">Logging In</h1>\n<p>Once you've scanned the QR code, you'll be asked to verify and approve the ongoing login attempt. You'll see a screen that looks like this!</p>\n<p><img class=\"shrinkToFit transparent\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/667100630820847618/669322222925512704/image0.png\" alt=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/667100630820847618/669322222925512704/image0.png\" width=\"474\" height=\"1029\"></p>\n<p>After approval, your desktop device will be logged in and ready to go! Want to log out of that device? Just head to User Settings &gt; Log Out on the desktop or browser client and you'll be logged out until your next session!</p>\n<h3>QR codes only last for 2 minutes.

Even if you've scanned a QR code that's opened the Discord app by mistake, you can prevent the login attempt right away.</p>\n<p><strong>Never approve a QR code login that you didn't generate yourself! </strong>If you've been sent a QR code by someone else that opened the login verification screen, <strong>hit cancel right away</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you approve a login that wasn't yours by mistake, you can <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/218410947\" target=\"_self\">change your Discord password</a> to log out all devices at once, including those you don't personally approve of.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don't forget that <strong>any QR code login attempt needs to be approved before it goes through</strong>. Keep an eye out for that verification screen and <strong>never verify or approve a login that you didn't ask for.</strong></p>\n<h3>If someone you don't know is asking you to login using a QR code, they may be trying to phish your account. You can learn more about phishing <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037660611\" target=\"_self\">here</a>!</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have feedback on this new feature, please don't hesitate to share it with us as well!

They are unlikely to be fixed and are working as intended:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt; behave the same way</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Links are not clickable</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Links won't

“/me” does not show a preview of the styled text</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The backticks show inside of the background color for inline code blocks</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The character counter may </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slightly </span></em><span

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hitting backspace after a mention deletes the entire mention</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an empty code block by putting a space between the two sets of ``` symbols</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bugs That Will Live:</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, here is a list of identified bugs that are considered relatively harmless and will remain in coexistence with the app:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rich chat box is turned off on the Android browser and in certain old browsers (such as Edge &lt;= 18)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-line bold/italics/underline/etc does not get styled</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In compact mode, RTL messages have a line break between the author's name and the message content</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot use triple-click to select an entire line of text when that line contains an emoji or mention</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inserting an emoji and then wrapping that emoji in an inline code block or multi-line code block will not down-convert it to plain text</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typing two regional indicator emojis will not combine them into the corresponding flag emoji</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you hold shift-enter to make the text box scroll, the editor will not be scrolled </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entirely </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to the bottom (but the last line of text is still visible)</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syntax highlighting in code blocks is turned off on the last line if the closing backticks do not end on their own line</span></li>\n<li

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Found More Bugs!</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a bug needs to be escalated to the Wizards for bad behavior, it would be extremely helpful to include the following, since often these bugs only reproduce on very specific setups:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Browser and browser version</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating system</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord release channel</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord build number</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyboard layout (meaning US/French/Chinese/etc)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language they are trying to type in</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you are trying to type</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you are unable to type something in a non-English language due to a bug, please follow the

break</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop recording and send it to us, along with an explanation of what is different between the behavior on that website vs Discord</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This tool records everything you are typing, so it both demonstrates how to reproduce the problem and what is supposed to happen, and your explanation at the end should confirm how Discord is broken.</span></p>\n<h2>How Do I Turn this off?</h2>\n<p>There <em>is</em> an option to turn off the new chat box! It will only show if users have access to the new chat box though, which currently means only Canary &amp; PTB users on the latest release will see it.<br><br>We are using this as a <em>temporary</em> option though, so that users who are stuck can turn it off, <strong>but our hope is to fix any major blockers so we can remove this option in the future.</strong></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Please send all reports of <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">new</span> issues with the new Text Chat Box to  dis.gd/contact and we’ll do our best to help out.</span></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong>Happy bug hunting!<br></strong></p>\n<p> </p>"

But since we’ve just automatically added a new Boost to the already boosted server, you can move that new second Server Boost to whichever server you want (no need to wait for a cooldown)! <br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- You can transfer this second Boost directly within the Server Boosting Menu in the User Settings </span>\n</h3>\n<p><strong>ALSO!</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Now that Nitro subscribers get that nifty second Boost, you’ll be able to </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue70\"><strong>solo</strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Boost any server to <strong>LEVEL 1</strong>! So if your server has been stuck at one Boost for these last few months, your server will now get automatically boosted to <strong>LEVEL 1</strong>! </span> </p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billing Process Changes</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these changes, it can be confusing juggling your Nitro subscription, and now not just one but </span><strong>MULTIPLE</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Server Boosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Server Boosting is its own thing and isn’t dependent on a Nitro subscription, we’ve made some updates to the billing process to make all that math simpler for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting today, </span><strong>Discord will now unify all charges for all subscription (including Nitro and Server Boosting) into one charge/payment</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>For more information on our payment/billing system, check out this article <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!</span></h3>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Got ideas for other cool Boosting shenanigans?</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to see EVEN MORE perks?

    "body": "<p>Ever had trouble connecting to Discord or seeing content in your favorite chats? One of the most common issues coming between you and your friends' cat pics is your <strong>domain name service provider</strong>. The domain name service, or DNS provider, is the service your computer uses to translate the text and code delivered by webpages into sweet and tasty internet content goodness.</p>\n<h1>Why Change DNS Providers?</h1>\n<p>Swapping your provider can make for a faster and more reliable web experience, and can often even improve your privacy, too! Changing your DNS provider is also one of the first solutions we recommend if you're encountering one of the following common service issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Degraded voice quality</li>\n<li>Images not loading</li>\n<li>Stuck in an update loop</li>\n<li>Unable to download Discord</li>\n<li>Can't connect to voice chat</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Which Should I Use?</h1>\n<p>Here at Discord, we typically recommend <strong>Google Public DNS </strong>and <strong>Cloudflare 1.1.1.1</strong>. Both Google and Cloudflare are trusted and dependable service providers whose servers we rely on for hosting Discord! We recommend these options because they deliver the most consistent and speedy access to text chat, images, videos, and even voice chat!<br><br><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Google Public DNS</strong></a> is easy to use on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can even work on your mobile device's wifi connection if you're willing to mess with some device settings!<br><br><a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/dns/\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Cloudflare 1.1.1.1</strong></a> works on computers just as well as Google Public DNS, but for users on mobile devices running Android and iOS, they offer a mobile app that lets you use their service as a replacement DNS provider for while you're on cellular data and not just wifi!</p>\n<p>The steps for changing your provider look different based on your platform, and the IP addresses can change over time, so we always recommend checking out the websites linked above first. That said, you can find some simple walkthroughs for various platforms below!</p>\n<h2>Windows 7 and 10</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <strong>Start</strong> menu, then type to search for and open the <strong>Control Panel</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Network and Internet</strong>, then select <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Change adapter settings</strong>, then right click the connection you're currently using and select <strong>Properties</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4</strong> and enter the IPv4 addresses listed by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#windows\" target=\"_self\">Google</a> or <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/dns/\" target=\"_self\">Cloudflare</a>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Internet Protocol Version 6</strong> and enter the IPv6 addresses listed by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#windows\" target=\"_self\">Google</a> or <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/dns/\" target=\"_self\">Cloudflare</a>.</li>\n<li>Click OK, then OK to close the Properties screen, then restart your browser and you're good to go!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>macOS</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>System Preferences</strong> in the Apple menu</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Network</strong>, then select the connection you're currently using and click <strong>Advanced...</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Open the <strong>DNS</strong> tab, then remove any servers listed currently.</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>+ icon </strong>to add your new IPv4 and IPv6 DNS addresses, as listed by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#mac_os\" target=\"_self\">Google</a> or <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/dns/\" target=\"_self\">Cloudflare</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>iOS and Android</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We typically recommend downloading the Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 app from the Apple <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627\" target=\"_self\">App Store</a> or the Google <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone\" target=\"_self\">Play Store</a> for ease of use!</li>\n<li>Advanced users can find instructions on how to manually change their WiFi DNS addresses on the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using\" target=\"_self\">Google Public DNS</a> website for Android and iOS.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n<strong>Note:</strong> When using Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 on your mobile device, you do not have to use Cloudflare's Warp or Warp+ VPN service in order to take advantage of their free DNS option!</h3>\n<p>Now you're all ready to browse the web with better speed--and hopefully, some of your most common Discord troubles should be resolved, too! If you're still running into a specific connection issue even after swapping your DNS provider, our support team is here to help you 24/7, too.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Our team has released a handful of initial patches to address this issue and will continue to work on the screenshare code over the next few patch releases, so please make sure to update to the latest version of Discord as a first step if you're still having trouble!<br><br>As a next step, if you're still having issues capturing audio from Google Chrome as of our latest update, make sure to try the following workaround!:<br><br>1) End your screenshare session and refresh the app with Ctrl + R</p>\n<p>2) Close Google Chrome then reopen it. Once Chrome is reopened, begin playing audio in the browser <strong>before</strong> launching a screenshare session.<br><br>3) Enable screenshare and try once more! <br><br>If you're still having trouble after giving this a shot, our support team is collecting data so we can get this fixed for everyone as soon as possible, so please don't hesitate to reach out to the team directly <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_self\">here</a>! </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Note: If you want to learn more about screenshare and audio capture, check out our article <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000982752\" target=\"_self\">here</a>!</h3>"

If you're missing an announcement post, it's likely the admins have chosen to not publish that post.</h3>\n<h1>How to remove</h1>\n<p>If you've got Manage Webhooks permissions, you can follow and unfollow servers at any time! If you want to stop receiving posts from a server that you followed, it's easy! Any servers you follow are added to your server as a Webhook. To unfollow a server, look for the server's listing in Server Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Channels Followed!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360094890534/integrations_channels_followed_modal.png\" alt=\"integrations_channels_followed_modal.png\"></p>\n<p>Delete the bot that corresponds with that server's name to unfollow it! The bot will be removed from your server and you'll stop receiving posts from the server right away. <br><br><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360029038871/Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.12.22_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.12.22_PM.png\"></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: You can use the Webhooks settings to modify your new follow bot too--you can change the channel it posts in, the bot's name, and the avatar of the bot, all using the Edit button! </span></h3>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All set!<br></span></h1>\n<p>Now you know all there is to know about Channel Following!

Though not intentional, there are various issues that can cause the install or update process to fail. You'll see this as an endless update, or an unexplained install error! In cases like these, completely reinstalling Discord will often improve our updater's performance and clear out any issues. Follow these steps!</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Note: Remember that Discord only supports MacOS 10.11 and up (El Capitan)</strong> <strong>or above! Also, if you're running macOS on a machine that wasn't produced by Apple (IE, a Hackintosh), you may run into unique issues!</strong>\n</h3>\n<h1>Reinstalling Discord</h1>\n<ul class=\"oldschool\">\n<li>Close Discord by using ⌘+Q or selecting the Quit option from the menubar, then make sure all Discord processes are terminated from within your Mac's <strong>Activity Monitor</strong>. (You can quickly launch the Activity Monitor by using Spotlight or Siri on your Mac!) <br><br>\n</li>\n<li>Delete the 2 following folders:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>~/Library/Application Support/Discord</li>\n<li>/Library/Application Support/Discord</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>To find those folders, open <strong>Finder</strong>, press <strong>⇧⌘+G </strong>(or <strong>Go &gt; Go to Folder</strong> in the menubar), and enter:</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em>~/Library/Application Support in the window and hit enter: </em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360018976612/Screen_Shot_2019-01-16_at_7.40.53_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2019-01-16_at_7.40.53_PM.png\"></p>\n<p> <em>Then /Library/Application Support in the run window and hit enter:</em></p>\n<p><em><br><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360018976652/Screen_Shot_2019-01-16_at_7.41.20_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2019-01-16_at_7.41.20_PM.png\"></em></p>\n<p>In both of these cases, find the Discord folders in these files and drag them to your Trash. <strong>Note:</strong> There may not be a Discord folder in the second file (/Library/Application Support). If there isn't, that's okay!<br><br>Next, open your <strong>Applications</strong> folder. Find Discord and drag it to your Trash. Finally, empty your Trash!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>If your OS tells you that the file cannot be deleted because it's still in use.

To clear up any networking issues, there's some basic troubleshooting steps you should try!</p>\n<p>First, try setting your DNS to Google Public DNS!</p>\n<ul class=\"oldschool\">\n<li>Open <strong>System Preferences </strong>from your Mac's Apple menu, then select <strong>Network</strong>. From there, choose the network you're currently using (for example, <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>)</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Advanced...</strong>, select the <strong>DNS</strong> tab in the top bar, then use the Plus button under <strong>DNS Servers</strong> to add the following DNS server options!\n<ul>\n<li>8.8.8.8</li>\n<li>8.8.4.4</li>\n<li>2001:4860:4860::8888</li>\n<li>2001:4860:4860::8844</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, then close System Preferences and try relaunching Discord!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If that doesn't do the trick, try renewing your Mac's IP address! </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open <strong>System Preferences </strong>from your Mac's Apple menu, then select <strong>Network</strong>. From there, choose the network you're currently using (for example, <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>)</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Advanced...</strong>, then select the <strong>TCP/IP </strong>tab</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Renew DHCP Lease</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>, close System Preferences, then try relaunching Discord once more!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Note: If none of these steps do the trick, reach out to our Support Team at https://dis.gd/contact</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>"

We also wanted to let you know how we use it, so if JSON and CSV files are spooky - don't fret! We're here to help.</p>\n<h1>What's Inside?</h1>\n<p><strong>Your Account</strong>: Your friends list, settings, username, email, avatar, connected accounts and any transaction history for Nitro. If you have created any developer applications, this will be included as well.<br><strong>Your Servers</strong>: Servers you’ve joined. If you own a server, it will also include that server’s icon, settings, roles, permissions, channels, audit log, and any custom emoji attached to it.  <br><strong>Your Messages</strong>: All messages you have sent in servers, DMs or group DMs, unless it has been deleted manually by you or someone else. This folder will also include links to attachments uploaded.<br><strong>Your Activity</strong>: Info about how you navigate the app, the times you used Discord, what games you played, and what servers you hung out in. We use this to improve Discord and tailor it to you.<br><strong>Your Programs</strong>: Any applications you have submitted for HypeSquad, Server Verification, the Partners Program, and other cool stuff.</p>\n<h3>Note: The link to download your Data Package will be valid for 30 days.</h3>\n<h1>Why do we need this data?</h1>\n<p>The ultimate function behind all of this data is to help Discord run. You do have the ability to update your <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004109911\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Privacy Settings</a>, but a good example of what this information does is help power features like the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001580091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Games Tab</a>. Let's look into what each folder of your Data Package contains.</p>\n<h3>Note: JSON files can be opened easily in Notepad, or you can drag and drop them into a browser like Chrome or Firefox. CSV files can easily be opened in Excel, or Google Sheets.</h3>\n<h2>Account</h2>\n<p>The account folder contains a couple different items. The first is the avatar that you are using. The second is a JSON file which contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether you allow e-mail notifications.</li>\n<li>Your Games Tab settings. (Users you subscribe to, Users you opt-out of including.)</li>\n<li>Your IP Address.</li>\n<li>Any accounts you have connected to Discord. (Twitch, Twitter, Steam, etc.) </li>\n<li>Your Discord discriminator number.</li>\n<li>A list of any active sessions you have; PC, Mobile, Browser. (IP Address included.)</li>\n<li>Your Friends list.</li>\n<li>Your Block list.</li>\n<li>Your Account Settings. (Dark Theme/Light Theme, Show Game Status, etc.)</li>\n<li>Payment Information. (If you have subscribed to Nitro.)</li>\n<li>Developer Information. (For any webhooks, bots, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>The activity folder contains four folders, each with a JSON file that has information about the actions you have taken on Discord. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analytics - This is a record of some of your actions within Discord. The information is used to improve your Discord experience.\n<ul>\n<li>You can disable tracking analytics here: <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety &gt; Turn Off 'Use data to improve Discord' </strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modeling - This is data we use to better tailor certain parts of Discord to you, like the Games Tab.\n<ul>\n<li>You can disable this here: <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety &gt; Turn Off 'Use data to customize my Discord experience'</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reporting - This folder contains a JSON file with data we use in order to operate our business. (Information such as messages sent, or your Nitro subscription, as an example.)</li>\n<li>Trust &amp; Safety - This folder contains data we use in order to protect our service from bad actors. This data is deleted after 180 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Messages</h2>\n<p>The messages folder contains all the messages that you have sent on Discord. These are broken down separately into folders based on Direct Messages, Group Direct Messages, and Channels that you have chatted in. The number for each folder is the Channel ID for where the messages were sent. There is a JSON file which also contains a full list of the folders included.</p>\n<p>When you select a folder, you'll notice it contains a couple items.

The Channel ID, and User IDs if it is a file containing messages from a DM or Group DM.</p>\n<p>The second is a CSV file which contains the transcript of your messages.

The Verification badge appears on the top left corner of a server.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to apply for a Verified server, you will need to have the following requirements at a minimum: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The applicant must both be the owner of the server and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an official representative of a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business, brand, or figure of public interest.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The applicant should authenticate any other relevant social accounts on their profile to help us verify the validity of the application.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The applicant should use a formal email address related to the brand, business or entity. This will make it easier for us to understand that they hold an official position.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When evaluating Discord Servers to determine if they're in the public interest and meet our verification criteria, we also look for the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Authentic</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Your community server represents a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">registered business, brand or public figure of interest. For example, a great way to show this is having a formal email address.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Original</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Your server must be the unique presence of the person or business it represents. We will only verify one official server per business / brand, though a company may have multiple brands (e.g., game franchises). There may be some exceptions, such as language or region-specific servers.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Recognizable</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: We look for well-known businesses, brands, or individuals with a strong following. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We take into account your social media presence - we don't consider paid or promotional content as sources for review. Your official website is taken into account but not a requirement.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Final verification is at the sole discretion of Discord.</strong> If your server doesn't meet the criteria for a verification badge, there are other ways to let people know it's authentic. For example, you can share your server invite from your official website or Twitter account.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Loss of verified status</strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In accordance with the </span><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/terms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord's Terms of Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Discord reserves the right to remove verification at any time. Reasons for removal may reflect behaviors on and off Discord that include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The server is inactive or is no longer supported.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The server is transferred to a user who is not officially affiliated with the business, brand, or public interest figure.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting hate and/or violence against, or directly attacking or threatening other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. Supporting organizations or individuals that promote the above.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inciting or engaging in harassment of others.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling, or attempting to sell, a verified server.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violence and dangerous behavior</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directly or indirectly threatening or encouraging any form of physical violence against an individual or any group of people, including threatening or promoting terrorism</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violent, gruesome, shocking, or disturbing imagery</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-harm, suicide</span></li>\n</ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engaging in activity on Discord that violates the </span><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/guidelines\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Guidelines.</span></a>\n</li>\n</ul>"

    "body": "<h3>As of July 14, 2023, we have paused Verified Server Applications at this time. If you have any questions, feel free to submit a request to the community team with <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000168511\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a>.</h3>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002666791\"></p>\n<p>Welcome to the official Verified Server Requirements document for Music Artists, Esports Organizations, Game Publishers or Developers! You may have the right qualifications for verification by being a game publisher or developer that has a server in support of your live, playable game. You may also qualify if you're a music artist that's verified on Spotify, or even an esports organization or team that has hosted or competed in an official tournament or league, but you'll also need to fully equip your server with these requirements below for setting up, moderating, and protecting your community server from abuse to get that server you own and manage officially official!</p>\n<h1>Moderators</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002685672\" alt=\"testHCModerators.gif\"></p>\n<p>First off, you’ll need to have a team of moderators to assist in keeping the server a fun and appropriate place to participate in as your community grows. The best moderators typically have experience participating in your community, and are enthusiastic and seasoned superfans! Additionally, each verified server should have a pre-written set of rules of behavior for the server to alleviate possible confusion or misunderstanding, and gives your team a good set of tools to moderate efficiently and transparently.</p>\n<h1>Verification Levels, Content Filtering &amp; 2FA</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115004120251\" alt=\"Authentication.gif\"></p>\n<p>As more and more popular public community servers have made their homes on Discord, we’ve added varying levels of server security features to meet the demand. Three important features that we require verified servers to implement are <strong>moderation levels</strong>, <strong>explicit content filter &amp; two factor authentication</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Moderation Levels:</strong> Located in the Server settings &gt; Moderation tab. Four different levels of verification can be enabled based on the desired level of security for new users joining the server to prevent spam / unhealthy users. For verified servers, we require at least a “Medium” level of moderation— in which users must have had their account for more than five minutes in order to participate in the server— to have a good balance between security and participation encouragement for new users. (You are more than welcome to set the verification higher or all the way to the max!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explicit Content Filter:</strong> In addition to preventing spam accounts from flooding the server, we’ve also implemented an explicit content filter. This will scan messages based on your desired level of security, then dispose of anything illegal or that is explicit content. Of the provided options, we require setting the filter to “Scan all messages” to prevent anything unsightly. It takes only one bad image to make a terrible experience for everyone involved</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Server Two-Factor Authentication: </strong>Prevent potentially dangerous administrative actions for users without two-factor authentication enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Channel Permissions and Organization</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002685632\" alt=\"channelsetup.gif\"></p>\n<p>Additionally, we require permission settings in each channel of the verified server to help keep things neat and tidy, like having different text channels and/or categories for specific purposes. For example, while a <strong>#general</strong> channel should encourage all users to chat, it may be helpful to disable message sending for all users but staff and moderators to create an effective <strong>#Announcements</strong> channel. Other similar setups that you might want to consider include <strong>#Rules</strong>, <strong>#AMA</strong> [Ask me Anything], or <strong>#Giveaways</strong> channels, all of which can be set so that only specific roles can post to them, making them effectively read-only channels for most users.</p>\n<h1>Private Channels</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002666871\" alt=\"modsandadmins.gif\"></p>\n<p>Similar permissions can be used to exclude specific roles from viewing certain channels. And verified servers in particular should include a <strong>#Moderators</strong> channel for moderators and staff to discuss rules, enforcement, or upcoming community events.</p>\n<h1>Server Notification Settings</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002685652\" alt=\"ServerNotifications.gif\"></p>\n<p>Newly-created Discord servers start with notifications set to all messages. While this is ideal for smaller, more intimate servers, it can get a little tiresome for larger communities. For this reason, we require that verified servers change this to the <strong>only @mentions</strong> option at the bottom of the overview tab within the server settings menu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Additional Examples &amp; Information</h1>\n<p>In addition to these requirements, there are many other options and add-ons that can simplify community building on Discord. Other community servers provide great additional references and are often happy to answer questions and offer their own tips and tricks to moderating servers.</p>\n<p>Discord also requires that all users abide by the <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_self\">Terms of Service</a> and the <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_self\">Community Guidelines</a>, and the Discord Trust and Safety team will enforce those rules. If you see users that are breaking those rules — for example, doxxing others, threatening them with harm, distributing viruses, or anything along those lines — you can not only ban them from your server, but we’d also suggest that you reach out to our Trust and Safety team <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a386f2a7-7fff-af8d-9342-c300490f6c1e\">through our app</span> and report the behavior so that we can take care of it.</p>\n<p>Outside of those Community Guidelines, you’re welcome to set the rules for your own server — but keep in mind that enforcement of those rules will be the responsibility of your moderators, and not Discord staff.</p>"

Channels flourished and the Server grew.

Then you're in the right place!</span></p>\n<h1>Categories and Sub-Channels</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you're starting a brand new server or implementing them into an existing one, you can bring order to your channels as \"sub-channels\" housed neatly under categories as you refine your server's layout. Think of a category like an umbrella!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like channels have permissions, so do categories. What's great is that you can use the permissions of the category to update and manage any channel that is housed under it. User roles will still be the basis for how permissions are assigned on an individual level, but channels can now 'sync' with categories to create a clean permission structure.</span></p>\n<h1>Adding a Category</h1>\n<p>To add a new category to your channel just right-click on your server icon or hit the chevron to the right of the server name!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">   <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058262011/Capture29.jpg\" alt=\"Capture29.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Type in the name and once created you can drag and drop it wherever you like in the channel list!</p>\n<h1>Drag and Drop</h1>\n<p>Now that you've got your categories in place you can start cleaning house. Because you can now change permissions on a category level when you -do- move something, you'll be asked if you want to sync the permissions. Sync permissions, you say? This means that we will automatically update the permissions on a channel to match those of the category upon a move, should you approve!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002139771/Sync_Permissions.png\" alt=\"Sync_Permissions.png\" width=\"369\" height=\"160\"></p>\n<h1>Permissions</h1>\n<p>With the introduction of categories there are now two default states for a channel; <strong>synced</strong> and <strong>not-synced</strong>. A synced channel will have permissions that completely match that of the category. </p>\n<p>Category permissions can be changed by right-clicking the category and clicking 'edit category'.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058262211/Capture30.jpg\" alt=\"Capture30.jpg\"><br> </p>\n<p>Click on the 'Permissions' tab to alter permissions and add roles</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002262992/mceclip13.png\"></p>\n<h3>Disabling `Read Text Channels &amp; See Voice Channels` will make the channels invisible to members that don't have access, rather than just showing them locked!</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002252011/mceclip14.png\"> </p>\n<h3>Note: If you change the permissions on a category, all channels that are synced will automatically update.</h3>\n<p>If you do not sync permissions when moving a channel between categories, or if you change an individual permission on the channel level, it will then show that the channel is not synced with the category.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002140091/synced_permissions.PNG\" alt=\"synced_permissions.PNG\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means the channel currently does not share the same permissions as the category and will not automatically update when you make changes to the categories permissions.</span></p>\n<p>Want that channel to get back in line with the category? Just head to the channel permissions menu and click the 'Sync Now' button as pictured above and it will match the channels permissions to the category once again!</p>\n<h3>Important Note: Synced and not-synced channels can coexist within a category. Changing a category’s permissions will change all synced channel’s permissions, but not the permissions of any not-synced channel!</h3>\n<p>One final note on category permissions - if you don't want to utilize them at all, you can leave all channels within the category as 'non synced' and manage them individually. Permissions can also be managed on a per-channel basis.</p>\n<h1>Notifications and Categories</h1>\n<p>With categories, you can manage how you want to see unread messages as well.</p>\n<p>If you mute the categories, you will still see if a channel has unread messages but won't receive notifications:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002228891/mceclip0.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">If you collapse the category, it will only show channels that have unread messages within them and you will still get your notifications:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002239832/mceclip1.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">If you mute and collapse a category, you'll hide all channels under the category and not display unread messages. A channel will only be surfaced again if you are mentioned directly or if a role you are a part of is mentioned:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002239912/mceclip2.png\"></p>\n<p>With just a bit of organization you can help your server feel simple and clean!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>"

If you want to party with all of your numerous friends more than 10, just make a server! </span></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Pro Tip: </span></em></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can also open up a DM with a friend, then click the \"Add Friends to DM\" button. This'll keep your old DM intact, but also start a new group DM with you, your previously mentioned friend, and anyone else you want to bring in.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/210120627/AddDmButtonHighlight.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That's all it takes! Now that you've got your friends all where you want them, we can dig in a bit and check out some more features group DMs have to offer. </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. </span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Ch-ch-ch-c</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">heck It Out:</span></span></p>\n<p>Many of the features you know and love in server text channels apply to group DM chats as well. You'll be able to chat with your friends without worrying about roles or managing invites, just add your friends and rock. There are a couple of neat tips and tricks to put your group DM into <em>MAXIMUM EFFORT OVERDRIVE</em>, so we'll start with the menu bar:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007785752/all_.png\" alt=\"all_.png\" width=\"721\" height=\"73\"></p>\n<p><em>Modern-day Discord hieroglyphics</em> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>A. </strong>Call button:</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007785792/call_.jpg\" alt=\"call_.jpg\" width=\"721\" height=\"73\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Clicking this icon will go ahead and initiate a call between you and all other members of the group DM. Anyone in the group can initiate a call at any moment, and you can join a pre-existing call by pressing this button as well. </p>\n<p>When you're in a call, you'll see avatars pop up for anyone who's joining, starting a call will summon all other members in the group chat, though they'll have to click \"Join Call\" to participate:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007786172/join_call2_.jpg\" alt=\"join_call2_.jpg\" width=\"601\" height=\"259\"></p>\n<p>We'll get more into the group call function in a bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>B. </strong>Mute Notifications:</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/210022168/Hieroglyph2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Clicking this icon will mute notifications for the group DM specifically. While Group DMs (like normal DMs) do usually give desktop notifications, muting the DM will prevent that, and you'll have to check up on any updates yourself. Good for especially chatty and multiple-time zone chats, or if you need to buckle down and focus on something else.</p>\n<p><em>Pro Tip: You can also mute the incoming / outgoing call sounds in your User Settings &gt; Notifications tab. </em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007786932/outgoingincoming_ring_.jpg\" alt=\"outgoingincoming_ring_.jpg\" width=\"635\" height=\"560\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>C. </strong>Pin Messages:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007785812/pin_bar__.jpg\" alt=\"pin_bar__.jpg\" width=\"721\" height=\"73\"> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As with normal pinned messages on servers, you can use the pin feature by <strong>right-clicking</strong> on the message you want to pin, or <strong>selecting the \"pin\" option by clicking the three dots</strong> at the far right of the chat window. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007787432/right_click_pin_.jpg\" alt=\"right_click_pin_.jpg\" width=\"542\" height=\"254\"></p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007838411/pin_.jpg\" alt=\"pin_.jpg\" width=\"542\" height=\"99\"></p>\n<p>Pinned messages will show when you click the icon and view the window. You can un-pin them, or jump directly to where they were in chat by clicking the \"jump\" icon, and show them to your friends. Highly recommended.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>D. </strong>Member List:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007785872/members_.jpg\" alt=\"members_.jpg\" width=\"721\" height=\"73\"> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All this icon does is show/hide the user list of who's in the DM. Hide to maximize chat space, show to remembers who's here and view profiles / DM members in the group chat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>E. </strong>Add Users:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007837131/adduser_.jpg\" alt=\"adduser_.jpg\" width=\"721\" height=\"73\"> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you want to add users to the current group DM you're in, you can use this button. You'll see the same \"Select Friends\" prompt as when you create a group DM as well. Anyone currently in the DM can add users up to the cap.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, you have the <strong>recent mentions</strong> and <strong>support articles</strong> icons. Those aren't specific to DMs, but they're helpful all the same.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007837231/mentions-support_.jpg\" alt=\"mentions-support_.jpg\" width=\"721\" height=\"73\"> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><font size=\"4\"><span style=\"line-height: 27px;\"><strong>3.</strong> Not-so-Odds and Ends of Group DMS</span></font></span></p>\n<p>Oh, but the party's just getting started! In addition to the action icons in the top menu, there are a few more important attributes to DMs in general.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>F.</strong> Kicking DM members:</span></p>\n<p>While anyone can add users to a group DM, <strong>only the starter of the DM can remove members.</strong> If you're the original trailblazer, you'll see the <strong>remove from group</strong> option by right-clicking that user's name:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007844231/remove_from_group_.jpg\" alt=\"remove_from_group_.jpg\" width=\"292\" height=\"580\"> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>G. </strong>Customizing the DM:</span></p>\n<p>Right-clicking the DM title in your DM list will give you the option to <strong>change or remove </strong>the DM icon. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007801052/leave_group__.jpg\" alt=\"leave_group__.jpg\" width=\"507\" height=\"346\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, you can <strong>rename the group DM</strong> by clicking the DM title at the top of the client window.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Similar to normal server text channels, you can copy + paste text using the right-click menu, peep a user's profile, mention, mute, add a note, or adjust their volume by right-click their user avatar. Loads of fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">4. </span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">The </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Good Stuff: Group Calls (And Private Calls Too!)</span></span></p>\n<p>Yes, yes, I know why you're all here. Since Group and Private Calls (1:1 calls, direct calls, whatever you'd like to call them) function a little differently, we'll break them into two separate sections.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>H. </strong>Group Calls:</span>  </p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, getting a group call going is pretty simple. Open the desired group DM (or follow previous steps) and click <strong>the call icon</strong> to call everyone in the group.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once your buddies join the call, you'll see their avatars stop flashing and start lighting up with a green circle, indicating voice activity. You'll also see a handy-dandy mute or deafen icon pop up if anyone decides to Discord-mute (or deafen) themselves as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/210121047/3ava_forJake.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, calls can be joined / left at any time. As long as there's one person left in a call, anyone else in the group can join back in! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007786172/join_call2_.jpg\" alt=\"join_call2_.jpg\" width=\"601\" height=\"259\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Pro Tip: Sure, there's a big red button labeled \"leave call\", but if you wanna see the fruits of our hard-earned labor, click the same call button in the top menu bar. Check out that super-slick animation that switches shapes!</em></p>\n<p>Amidst all of the chaos of a group call, you can still type and send emojis in the group chat!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/210120987/NerdCentral.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>But who's the real nerd here?</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>I.</strong> Private Calls:</span></p>\n<p>Oh, but you don't need to have a group DM to call your friends! That same call button we looked at in the group DM screen? You can also find it <strong>in an individual DM as well.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/210120967/INDIVIDCALL.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"899\" height=\"197\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This'll start a private call between just the two of you. Mano e mano. This town's not big enough for the two of us, and there's only one way out. To di- err.. Just click the hang up button.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you don't have a DM open (or don't want one) with someone you want to call, you can find a call button by hovering over that user's name in your user list:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007838851/call_from_friends_.jpg\" alt=\"call_from_friends_.jpg\" width=\"2085\" height=\"119\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And that wraps up group DMs, calls, and everything associated. While we went over the basic ways to maneuver your way through group calls, the list of steps here isn't all-inclusive. We've included a lot of the same steps in various right-click menus, so you can find whichever way works best for you in any combination of steps!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

You'll directly land on \"My Account\", which will offer Two-Factor Authentication right underneath your username/avatar/email info.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058182311/Capture13.jpg\" alt=\"Capture13.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Once you click the enable button, you'll see a new 3 step prompt pop up. To begin the 2FA process, you'll either need to download Google Authenticator or Authy on your mobile device. Either one of these programs will work here.</p>\n<p><a name=\"auth\"></a></p>\n<h1>Authenticate me, Google!</h1>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you're using Google Authenticator, you'll be prompted to choose your input method, either <strong>scanning a barcode</strong> or <strong>entering a provided key</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208466847/GASetup.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\"></p>\n<p>Either one of these will work fine (since Discord provides both input methods) but keep in mind, <strong>Google Authenticator on Android will need you to install another barcode scanning app if you want to use that option.</strong> They require the <strong>ZXing</strong><strong>Barcode Scanner</strong> app, which is totally fine and dandy:</p>\n<p><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208453968/ZXing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"137\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Or, you can just input the code provided in Discord; no Barcode Scanner required.</p>\n<h1>Using Authy</h1>\n<p>Within Authy, you'll first need to enter your phone number and email to authenticate your phone:</p>\n<p><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/207674267/AAA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>You'll see a new pop-up with the option to verify via phone call or text message. Internal testing has yielded results that claim that the most recent smartphones are in fact capable of making and receiving phone calls, despite how rare this phenomenon appears.</p>\n<p>Once you've authenticated your device, go ahead and press the \"+\" button in the center to add a new authentication account. Finally, you'll reach the \"Authenticator Accounts\" screen. You'll have the option to scan a QR code, or enter the code manually.</p>\n<p><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/207674447/ScantimeSrs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"749\"></p>\n<h1>By our powers, combined!</h1>\n<p>Use Authy's (or Google Authenticator's) QR scanner on the QR code provided within Discord here:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/207611868/QRTime.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"546\"></p>\n<p>This'll generate a 6 digit code that is the final piece to enabling 2FA in Discord.

This is to help should you be worried about losing access to your authenticator app say by dropping your phone in water/lava/a hippo/etc.</p>\n<p>Make sure to also download your backup codes. Keep them safe, and loved. Tuck a paper copy of them in your diary, or your dairy. Your choice.</p>\n<h2>I'll do it later!</h2>\n<p>Didn't have time to add your phone as back up? Forgot to download your backup codes? It's all good, You can still do this in your account settings! Your settings screen will now look like this:<br><br><span style=\"text-align: center;\">Account Settings &gt; My Account</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360064012212/My_Account.png\" alt=\"My_Account.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Click that 'Enable SMS Authentication' button.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360064012372/Enter_Phone_Number.png\" alt=\"Enter_Phone_Number.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Verify that number in Discord.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360064161091/Enter_Code.png\" alt=\"Enter_Code.png\"></p>\n<p>After you have enabled SMS Authentication, your login screen will look like this:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360064161151/Login_Screen.png\" alt=\"Login_Screen.png\"></p>\n<p>Now when you login, if the feature is enabled, you will have a link to request an SMS with a code to authenticate yourself as a backup option.</p>\n<h3>Note: To download your backup codes, simply click on the 'View Backup Codes' button and enter your password. Should you ever have to reset 2FA on your account - make sure to save a new set of Backup Codes, as each set is unique to when you enable 2FA on your account.</h3>\n<h1>Server-Wide 2FA</h1>\n<p>Server owners also have an extra security lever they can pull to prevent unwanted perpetrators from causing havoc in their servers.</p>\n<p>In your Server settings menu, you'll see a Moderation tab that allows you to require 2FA server-wide. While this doesn't require everyone that joins the server to have 2FA enabled, it does mean that anyone with admin powers won't get to use them unless they enable it. They'll see this pop up instead:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/207834588/Can_tLetYouDoThat.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The specific permissions that are disabled (\"Admin privileges\") include:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kick Members, Ban Members, Administrator, Manage Channels, Manage Server, Manage Roles, and Manage Messages.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Clicking the Resolve link in the popup will bring you directly to the security tab in your User Settings menu, where you can follow the above listed steps to get that set up and regain your Admin powers.</p>\n<p><a name=\"mobile2fa\"></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Mobile 2FA</h2>\n<p>Wumpus has heard your calls, so we are happy to announce that you can now Enable and Disable 2FA from your mobile devices!

To fix this, he went through these steps:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>1.</strong></span> Allowing the \"admin\" role to manage permissions (since Mallow's an admin, this permission will only apply to him):</span></p>\n<p> <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206590238/AdminYes.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>2.</strong></span> And THEN denying the permission to the @everyone role:</p>\n<p> <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206590248/EveryoneNo.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And now the proper permissions are in place!

    "body": "<p>At Discord, we're always taking steps to improve connection stability and ping spike issues for users experiencing issues. If you've gone through all the troubleshoot steps to improve ping spikes in your connection to voice channels, running a WinMTR can give us extremely useful information about your connection. To gather the necessary details, follow these steps:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1. </span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Download WinMTR from the website</span></span></p>\n<p>First, go to <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/\">WinMTR's download page.</a> You'll have a choice to select either the 32 or 64 bit version of WinMTR. Downloading the file from either link will give you a zip file with both versions, so if the 64 bit doesn't work, you can use 32 bit anyways. No big deal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. </span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Installation</span></span></p>\n<p>This is the easy part. Open the zip file, and extract the program file. You'll get a document folder containing the WinMTR file. That's it!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3. </span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Implement the Traceroute</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">When you start the program, you'll get a small box with a couple of windows and some drop down menus.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205443497/WinMTRWin.png\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here's where we get Discord specific. We'll need the server name and number in the \"Host\" box to get the specific traceroute for that voice server. To do that, you first need to make sure Developer Mode is enabled.</p>\n<p><strong>Go to User Settings through the cog wheel at the bottom left corner &gt; Advanced &gt; enable Developer Mode.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4443209096215/Developer_Mode.png\" alt=\"Developer_Mode.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Next, connect to the voice channel you're having ping issues on.</strong></p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058239171/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\"></p>\n<p><strong>Second, click the \"Voice Connected\" icon to pull up the voice server specifics.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058076692/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\"></p>\n<p>Now that we have all the information we need, it's important to type the correct IP into the WinMTR window. To do this, take <strong>the name and number of the voice server you're connected to</strong> (in the case above, mine would be \"us-south495\") and <strong>add \".discord.gg\" </strong>to the end of it. As such, the end product would be:</p>\n<p><strong>us-south495.discord.gg</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Great. Now enter it into the WinMTR window:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205446917/enteredIPWinmtr.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And hit Start! Be patient with the traceroute, it can take a few minutes to complete. When you're done, you'll get a list of hops in the window:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205449427/resultWinMTR.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To make sure the traceroute is effective and accurate, make sure this number has reached at least 500:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205449847/Usefulnumber.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>"

This is particularly useful in preventing bots and spam accounts from mass-joining your server, especially if you've made it public or have a never-expiring Instant Invite hanging around the web somewhere. We can see there's five different levels of verification to check out here, so let's break them down piece by piece:</p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-64c22511-7fff-2b00-eaa5-0fc9a719ded4\">None:</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471524504983\" alt=\"None.png\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-65b95ece-7fff-c508-4537-45bb07d1e590\">Selecting none will forego any verification security, and anyone who enters your server will be able to chat immediately upon entering. Better suited for private servers amongst your buddies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-a1255d61-7fff-ac8f-1bbf-0f1b16911499\"> Low:</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471623345815\" alt=\"Low.png\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-9a964d9b-7fff-f5b6-8eb8-a6cfc5cfa7c2\">If you've set your server verification settings to Low, the user must have a <strong>verified email</strong> on their Discord account before they're approved to participate in the server. Steps for verifying your email can be found in this article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-60a68900-7fff-1434-2872-495db8e78f40\">Medium:</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471627996695\" alt=\"Medium.png\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-08dc006c-7fff-3248-e943-3914fb4500f6\">Medium server verification settings will require your Discord account to have a <strong>verified email</strong>. It must be <strong>verified for longer than five minutes</strong> before you are able to start chatting in the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-104e550e-7fff-84b6-75ff-b02f9ffe572b\">High:</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471689677335\" alt=\"High.png\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-f8e458dd-7fff-e07b-d171-47d2b174aaed\">High is the next step security setting you can lockdown your server with. Including requiring a <strong>verified email</strong> AND being <strong>registered on Discord for more than 5 minutes</strong>. You must also be present in the server for longer than 10 minutes. </p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-72d0b9b6-7fff-3abb-de82-0e3155c08594\">Highest:</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471723597975\" alt=\"Highest.png\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-b5f8de4d-7fff-95c9-a36a-8218f5428567\">Highest is the maximum level of security you can add to your server. In addition to everything above (verified email, registered user for 5+ minutes, and server member for 10+ minutes), they will also need to have a verified phone number attached to their Discord account. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GSDVBNM4DA1F0XGK606NP841\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\">How do I find it?</span></h1>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-d6018c64-7fff-bd92-0242-f14aa1298490\">If you would like to change the Verification Levels for your server, you can do so via the desktop client or the mobile app. </p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-b85c1119-7fff-6db8-8f56-4c3680a76ace\">Desktop: </h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471791544599\" alt=\"veri.gif\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-5176f619-7fff-f2a2-60b2-0212ef496819\">1, While in the desktop client, press the dropdown menu next to your server’s name to navigate to your <strong>Server Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471795878935\" alt=\"veri_lvl1.png\" width=\"345\" height=\"410\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12471795876759\" alt=\"veri_lvl2.png\" width=\"345\" height=\"411\"></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-e857e195-7fff-a283-0b70-6ba35d2790f6\">2.

This is where you can customize your notifications for this server.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8513512984599/notification-settings-1.png\" alt=\"notification-settings-1.png\" width=\"403\" height=\"538\"></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_3d6f7848-f80f-49d5-aaab-5dba23d2c3f8\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Server-Wide Mute</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Simplest addition first. Instead of <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209791877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">muting each channel individually</a>, you can check the mute server box to auto-mute each channel within the server. Keep in mind, this is a blanket mute, and isn't selective. You'll notice that the bell icons next to channel names don't update when this option is selected, but all of the options in the notification settings blur out:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360086360213/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\" width=\"317\" height=\"417\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360085183074/Capture__1_.JPG\" alt=\"Capture__1_.JPG\" width=\"313\" height=\"417\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Awesome. Remember, this will mute:</p>\n<p>ALL NOTIFICATIONS.</p>\n<p>ALL CHANNELS.</p>\n<p>IN THE SELECTED SERVER.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>with the exception of @everyone mentions. </strong>This also means you won't get Mobile Push Notifications if you switch over to mobile. More on that in a bit.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_02a56972-cd54-4811-8f94-85c556a44e2d\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Server Notification Settings</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Alright. We found the total nuclear option in notification muting. Let's get a little more in-depth.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360085183114/Capture__2_.JPG\" alt=\"Capture__2_.JPG\" width=\"534\" height=\"347\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Starting with the selection on the top, the circular option selections actually apply to each channel in a similar blanket format as the mute server option, but with the added option of allowing us to choose different levels of notifications.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Clicking an option in the Server Notifications Settings updates all of our settings instantly:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 406px;\" width=\"715\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 343.75px;\"><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204624478/NewNotifMen__1_.png\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td style=\"width: 347.5px;\"><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204624388/PerChanMention.png\" alt=\"\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 343.75px;\"><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204624398/NewNotifNoth.png\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td style=\"width: 347.5px;\"><img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204640857/PerChanNoth.png\" alt=\"\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Pretty straightforward. Moving on, the other two functions in the window are pretty simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Suppress @everyone </strong>option disables any @everyone mention from generating a notification, on the entire server.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Mobile Push Notifications</strong> option means any notification you'd normally get adds a push notification on your Android / iOS device if you're signed on with the same account! Super handy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_570c11eb-b007-4e7c-8ae8-77515ea40c6a\">Channel Notification Settings</h1>\n<p>The last section of the notification settings menu lets you adjust individual settings per channel. Use the <strong>Notification Overrides</strong> section to select different channels in a drop-down. There are a few settings to explore here:</p>\n<p>Just like before, you can mute individual channels entirely by selecting mute. You can still do this on the main channel page, but here <span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">you can quickly address problem channels in a list fashion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360085183194/Capture23.jpg\" alt=\"Capture23.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Even after each channel updates based on how you selected your server notification settings, you can make individual channel notification selections in the scroll down menu as well.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360085183214/Capture24.jpg\" alt=\"Capture24.jpg\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GBNZRGVFG37B8SE6KG3DYM6Q\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlight Notifications Settings</span></h1>\n<p>Highlights bring you the best content from the servers you care about. If you are opted in to receive Highlights for a server, Discord will notify you via email of the best messages, events, announcements, and more from that server. <br>The Highlights setting is an additional suppression toggle you can turn on or off in each server. It is located in your server notification settings.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/9510431748119\" alt=\"highlight_settings.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"759\"></p>\n<p>This setting operates the same way as the ‘Suppress @everyone and @here’ and ‘Suppress All Role @mentions’ settings, but it suppresses Highlight Notifications when the toggle is turned on. The setting also operates independently of your server notification settings (all messages, @mentions only, or nothing). For example, you can have your server notifications settings set to Nothing and still receive Highlights notifications if you have not turned on the ‘Suppress Highlights’ toggle. Muting a server will turn off the Highlights toggle, and you will not receive any notifications from that server.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about Highlights <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/5304469213079\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And that wraps up the notifications menu. Pretty neat, huh? </p>"

BB maker and Cats have the same roles with the exception of PUBG, so they inherit the next highest role and color, \"Overwatch\" and blue. </p>\n<p>You can also drag to re-arrange roles and their position on the metaphorical totem pole: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001756771/Role_Management_101_Update.gif\" alt=\"Role_Management_101_Update.gif\" width=\"685\" height=\"345\"></p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001762851/rename.png\" alt=\"rename.png\"></p>\n<p>After:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001763372/rename2.png\" alt=\"rename2.png\"></p>\n<p>In this instance, all I did was drag \"PUBG\" up to the top, above Overwatch. As a result, everyone has inherited its orange color, as well as PUBG being listed first under my role titles. I still have my old Overwatch role, but it's lower on the list, so I lose my shiny blue badge of honor.</p>\n<p>You'll also see the color of your highest-sorted role in the user's list as well:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001763131/Screen_Shot_2017-08-17_at_2.07.37_PM.jpg\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2017-08-17_at_2.07.37_PM.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"413\"></p>\n<p><em>In this case, some roles have the \"Display role members separately from online members\" permission checked, but the others don't, such as the pink Rocket League role here. Each user in this list has a different highest role.</em></p>\n<h1>Part Two: Role Hierarchies</h1>\n<p>In addition to looking pretty, roles offer a very structured way to delegate permissions to users and establish anything from a multi-tiered public server admin system to a trusted buddy in your private server helping out here and there. </p>\n<p><font size=\"4\"><u>Role Linear Hierarchy:</u></font></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001756972/Role_Linear_Hierarchy__1.5.jpg\" alt=\"Role_Linear_Hierarchy__1.5.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"466\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The blurple arrow is your highest role; roles now follow a linear hierarchy. In simpler terms, the \"metaphorical totem pole\" is now a bit more literal in practice.</span></p>\n<p><strong>All roles equal to and above your roles will appear with a lock next to their name</strong>. This enables server owners to establish multiple roles with separate administrative powers that can't interfere with each other. Here are some of the tools that enable hierarchies to work:</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Administrator:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001756911/Administrator__1_.jpg\" alt=\"Administrator__1_.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"426\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is the omega role! Giving this role to a user grants them <strong>all of the permissions in the permissions list! They also cannot be locked out of any voice or text channel, regardless of permissions.</strong> That's a tall order. This permission also lets users with that role assign any permission to roles underneath them in the hierarchy, though they still can't affect their role and any above them in the hierarchy. Real talk: with great permissions power comes great permissions responsibility. Assign with caution.</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Manage</strong><strong> Roles:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001756992/Manage_roles_1_.jpg\" alt=\"Manage_roles_1_.jpg\" width=\"686\" height=\"341\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This permission allows a role to create new roles beneath them, then edit them accordingly. Keep in mind that this role comes 2nd to the Administrator role, and although you can add, edit, and assign new roles to users, you <strong>still can't edit your role and roles above yours.</strong> <strong>Additionally, you can only assign permissions that you have to roles under you</strong>. If your role doesn't have banning members enabled, you can't let other users ban them either. Duh. </span></p>\n<p>Another important point to remember about managing roles is <strong>if you have multiple roles, you can't remove a permission from a lower role that would remove it from yourself. </strong></p>\n<h3>Important note on adding roles: the <strong>@everyone</strong> role now serves as the basic template for all added roles. Want anyone in your server to add channels as they want? Assigning \"Manage Channels\" to @everyone will automatically grant that permission to all other roles created. Any role assigned to @everyone will be universal, regardless of assignment in higher roles.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001757012/Newrole_1_.jpg\" alt=\"Newrole_1_.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"466\"></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that when you add a new role (if you're not the server owner), that the roles are added at the very bottom, right above the @everyone role, so that you can sort it as necessary, but not above your role.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Ban/Kick/Nickname Hierarchy:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001757032/Screen_Shot_2017-08-18_at_10.45.19_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2017-08-18_at_10.45.19_AM.png\" width=\"685\" height=\"522\"></p>\n<p>Additional to the role sorting hierarchy, there's a special exception placed on banning, kicking, and nicknaming members: <strong>Even if users have ban/kick/nickname permissions, they <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">cannot ban / kick / change nicknames of anyone with the same role or a role higher than theirs.</span></strong>  </p>\n<h1>Part Three: Channel Permissions</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001756931/Channelpermission__1_.jpg\" alt=\"Channelpermission__1_.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"473\"></p>\n<p>If you're one of the more orderly types that enjoy the thrill of sorting your clothes into oodles of boxes, then the right-click menu has some helpful tools for you as well. These shortcuts apply when setting up individual text channel permissions, instead of working in the server settings. </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Clone Channel:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001756951/Clone_Channel__1_.jpg\" alt=\"Clone_Channel__1_.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"473\"></p>\n<p>This option will create a new text channel with the exact same role-specific permissions as the previous one selected. You'll be given the choice to name the new channel, then poof, done. You can go in and edit specific permissions once the channel is created. </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Creating role-exclusive Text Channels:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001757011/Screen_Shot_2017-08-24_at_10.28.18_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2017-08-24_at_10.28.18_AM.png\"></p>\n<p>When you (or anyone with the \"manage channels\" permission) creates a new channel, you'll see the option to select specific roles that can access the new channel. Selecting a role does two things in the permissions menu:</p>\n<p>1. First, denies the @everyone role the \"read messages\" permission to this new channel, making it inaccessible and invisible to them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001757172/Textpermissions_1_.jpg\" alt=\"Textpermissions_1_.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"491\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. Also, specifically adds an exception for the role(s) selected. You'll see both of these changes reflected in the Channel Permissions screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115001757212/Textchannelspermissions_2_.jpg\" alt=\"Textchannelspermissions_2_.jpg\" width=\"686\" height=\"402\"></p>"

Before we start creating channels, let’s create some roles for our members and we’ll go over what each role is for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910492490391\" alt=\"community_server_roles.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Head Orchard</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Role for someone that is an administrator on the server. With this role they have all edit and manage permissions enabled for the server.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Farmhand</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Role for someone that is a moderator on the server. They don’t have the exact same permissions as an admin would (Head Orchard), but they do have some permissions that a regular member would not. For example: ability to delete messages from other members, able to post in the announcement channel, etc.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Team Apple Captain</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - This role is for someone that is a Team Captain. Because they are part of a team, they have access to all Team Apple text and voice channels. They can not access the channels for other teams or admin and moderators.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Team Cherry Captain</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - This role is for someone that is a Team Captain. Because they are part of a team, they have access to all Team Cherry text and voice channels. They can not access the channels for other teams or admin and moderators.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Team Lemon Captain</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - This role is for someone that is a Team Captain.

They do not have access to any of the team channels or admin and moderator channels, but they do have access to channels like #general that is for everyone.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GM48WF09GZG8K7XZEN3F8TDS\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Categories</span></h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our example for a community server, <em>Orchard eSports</em> is an eSports organization that has 3 teams (Apple, Cherry, and Lemon). Now that we have roles created, let’s get started on some categories for our text and voice channels to be under. You can even set up permissions to be category-specific, so it applies to all text and voice channels nested inside of the category.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910496643095\" alt=\"community_server_categories.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The categories we have for our server are: Welcome, Team Apple, Team Cherry, Team Lemon, and Voice Channels.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910497712407\" alt=\"advanced_community_category_settings.gif\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we want only members of Team Apple to be able to view all of the text channels in that category, we can do so through category permissions.

This means the category will automatically sync the permissions for all text and voice channels under this category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we set it so Team Apple members can view these channels, let’s also make it so other members of the server can not.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910534161431\" alt=\"community_server_categories_view.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With @everyone selected we want to make sure </span><strong>View Channels</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is disabled.

We want this setting enabled so someone can see new and past messages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s it! Now that we’ve created categories and text channels, let’s move on to voice channels.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GM48WKSY357DVV55B5GX1B8B\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Text channels</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re going to continue to use our example server, Orchard eSports, to help us in creating some text channels for our members to chat in! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One recommendation for creating a server is to have a </span><strong>welcome channel </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for when new members join. This allows new users to get some information about the server and allows you, your mods, and even server members to see when someone new has joined. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910542322071\" alt=\"community_server_welcome_channel.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perfect! You can see here that when a new member joins the message is automatically shared in the </span><strong>welcome channel</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can have this information shared anywhere, but it is quite handy for when new members join especially if an admin or a moderator needs to add specific roles for this user.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>To set up the system message for when someone joins the server head to Server Settings &gt; Overview and set the channel under “System Messages Channel”. While there you can also enable or disable any additional settings for the system message.</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910567418903\" alt=\"community_server_announcements_channel.jpg\"></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s go ahead and also create an </span><strong>announcements channel</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this is where an admin or moderator can post updates about the server or upcoming tournaments. This channel should be readable by anyone that joins it, however, only admins and moderators should be able to post in this channel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we want new members in the server to be able to read the announcement channel, but not be able to post any messages of their own, we'll want to restrict their permission access. </span></p>\n<h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about channel permissions, please check out the </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10543994968087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Channel Permissions Settings 101</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article.</span>\n</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some examples of enabled settings and how the announcement permissions are set up for everyone and why.

Voice channels are very similar to text channels in the sense that you can have specific permissions for them. Each team in this server has their own voice channel that only a member of that team has access to. These voice channels are in the team-specific categories, but you can also just have one category for all voice channels. After setting up team specific channels, we set up some general channels for the teams to come together and chat, or for other members of the server to join as well.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910600919831\" alt=\"community_server_voice_channels.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s go over the voice channel settings for the Lobby voice channel that we set up.

    "body": "<p>Here we'll address what's going on with Discord's two voice input modes, Push-to-Talk and Voice Activity. To access either of these methods, just maneuver through your User Settings &gt; Voice &amp; Video tab.</p>\n<p><em>Note: If you're having trouble with Push-to-Talk while running a game in Administrator mode, <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/205082178\" target=\"_self\">check out this article</a>.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Voice Activity</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is most likely the more familiar method for users. There's only one setting to mess with here, and that's input sensitivity!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058237991/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\"><br>   </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Chances are, if you're using the desktop client, the \"Automatically Determine Input Sensitivity\" has impacted your audio in some way, shape, or form. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>If your mic jumps from too loud to too soft, or some of your voice is getting cut off at the end of sentences, uncheck this box!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Why's that? Essentially what's happening is that Discord is trying to adjust your mic to an ideal speaking level based on the volume of what's coming into your mic. While Discord is usually pretty good at this, some of you guys might have some serious room noise, or wide variances in speaking volume. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">When you do uncheck the box, you'll be given the option to adjust your input sensitivity by yourself.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>The key here is to leave the sensitivity marker high enough that nothing is transmitted when you're not speaking:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058075272/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\">                          <em>Make sure the bar is only yellow when you're not speaking.</em> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>But still low enough so that it doesn't cut out your voice when you speak softly: </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058075332/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\"><br> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Remember, we want to put the sensitivity marker right between your softest speaking voice and any other noise coming through. This will take some tweaking on your part!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em>Important note about Voice Activity mode: due to how Voice Activity functions, there is an inherent 200ms delay, plus the distance you are from the active server.</em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>\n<h2 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Push-to-Talk</strong></span></h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Push-to-Talk (PTT) changes things up a bit, in the sense that Discord doesn't pass any incoming audio at all unless you press and hold a dedicated \"PTT key\". </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058075432/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Only a few things we need to tweak here. Since we've got the input mode selected already, all that's standing between us and sharing our innermost thoughts with our buddies is setting a keybind. To do this, just click on the shortcut box, and press your desired PTT key. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">                                  <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058238151/Screenshot__79_.png\" alt=\"Screenshot__79_.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Once your desired PTT key is in the box, you're ready to begin pushing to talking. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Last point on Push-to-Talk: The PTT Release Delay slider.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058075512/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"Capture.JPG\" width=\"371\" height=\"87\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">This important tool affects how long PTT waits to cut off audio after you let go of your dedicated keybind.</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Think of PTT like a door; your keybind is what opens the door, and the Release Delay is how long it takes for that door to close. Door closed = no audio passes through. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Oh, and remember how we have that pesky 200ms delay from Voice Activity? Guess what? Push-to-Talk has 0. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Pretty sweet.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em>Important note #2: Push-to-Talk only works in the browser app when the window is in focus. If you want to use PTT system wide, you'll have to download the desktop client!</em></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">You've now officially passed your first class in Discord's voice input methods! Get out there and proclaim your awesomeness to your friends, with either PTT or Voice Activity.</p>"

    "body": "<p>Hello there! If you’ve found your way to this Help Center article, you’ve likely gained access to a new mobile layout that we are testing with a limited number of users. If you’ve been using Discord for a while now, you probably noticed the mobile layout was designed to reflect the desktop layout. With this new iteration of Discord on mobile, we hope to make the mobile experience feel like it was optimized for your mobile device rather than a scaled-down desktop app. The new mobile design aims to simplify and improve the Discord experience for everyone by creating a more organized, more streamlined, and better-looking mobile app that helps you get to your chats quickly and easily. </p>\n<p>We’re actively gathering feedback during the testing period to ensure that we continue to provide the best experience on Discord. For those of you that have already tried the mobile app, thank you for all the thoughtful feedback you've shared with us so far! We've been paying great attention to it and it's helping us continue to make improvements. If you’re new to this version of the app, be sure to explore the new mobile layout and give it a heartfelt try. And if it doesn’t work, that’s okay — you’re welcome to turn it off and go back to the old look (more on that below), but we’d love to know how your experience went. If something doesn’t work for you, please let us know so we can continue to improve upon this new mobile app design! </p>\n<p>This Help Center article will explain the core changes to the mobile layout, how you can provide feedback and thoughts on what does or doesn’t work for you, and how to opt out if you prefer.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: Some of the changes and features outlined in this article are still experiments and you may not see them in your app even if you are using the new layout.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What does this article cover?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01H78YWA532XSZCT0MNBVTS4CY\" target=\"_self\">What’s Changed?</a>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01H78YWFNY76BQ6SJKX33KF500\" target=\"_self\">Servers Tab</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Active Now</li>\n<li>Favorite Channels</li>\n<li>Search </li>\n<li>Channel Details Page</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01H78YX7KE1BTX3T3XRK0AVQVA\" target=\"_self\">Messages Tab</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Active Now</li>\n<li>Favorite DMs</li>\n<li>DM/GDM Details Page</li>\n<li>DM/GDM Creation</li>\n<li>Add Friends</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01H78Z4CD44X3GC38QEZZR7K1V\" target=\"_self\">Notifications Tab</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01H78Z4MTG2HN9MK9NH1MS4VDX\" target=\"_self\">You Tab</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Friends List</li>\n<li>Settings</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01H78Z01FFM9K93PXN98336N4X\" target=\"_self\">Voice &amp; Video Calls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01H78YZV2T3S317NGYTXCTH7SP\" target=\"_self\">Swipe to Reply</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01H78YZP2ME5ZAJD5GTS37NAGV\" target=\"_self\">How to Provide Feedback</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01H78YZGVWZ7JQNCRWT5RWR7HX\" target=\"_self\">How to Opt Out of the New Layout</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01H78YZBX97NABT9HF0NG7YJZR\" target=\"_self\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H78YWA532XSZCT0MNBVTS4CY\">What’s Changed? </h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H78YWFNY76BQ6SJKX33KF500\">Servers Tab</h2>\n<p>In the new mobile layout, your servers are in their own dedicated “Servers” tab, located at the bottom-left corner of the app. Once you open the “Servers” tab, you’ll see all of your servers at the bottom of the screen in a row.

    "body": "<p>Partnered servers are at the forefront of the community. We want our Partnered servers to be welcoming to all users, whether they are complete newcomers to Discord or expert users and longtime members. We look to our partners to provide a positive place for people to come together around their communities.</p>\n<p>As a Partner, always remember to conduct yourself in a responsible manner and treat others with respect, patience, and kindness. Whether you’re on-stream, chatting, or showing off the profile badge you’ve earned, your actions are a reflection on Discord itself.</p>\n<p>We require owners, admins, and moderators in Partnered servers to uphold the rules laid out below in this Partner Code of Conduct, as well as those detailed in our <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discordapp.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terms of Service</a>, and <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discordapp.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Guidelines</a>. </p>\n<p>Failure to uphold these standards will lead to a warning, both through email and in the application itself, and a chance to correct the violation. If action is not taken on the reported content within 48 hours, we will take additional action, including the removal of partnership status. Any further violations of the Partner Code of Conduct may also result in the partnership being removed.</p>\n<p>The following Code of Conduct outlines our requirements for Partnered servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-behavior-engagement-with-users\"><strong>I. BEHAVIOR &amp; ENGAGEMENT WITH USERS</strong></h2>\n<p>As a Partner, always keep in mind how your statements may be perceived by others. Even if you intend something as a joke, there may be others who do not see it as such.</p>\n<p>This does not mean we will revoke partnership if a user says something offensive in your server. We understand the challenges of moderating big servers — especially ones that have users that are from all over the world. However, we do expect you to build a moderation team that will take action on issues within a reasonable timeframe. Having no moderation or claiming the server is too big to moderate is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Partnered servers should be an example of the best communities that Discord has to offer, and so we have a higher standard for the conversation and moderation of those servers. The following is prohibited in a partnered Discord:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discriminatory jokes and hate speech (attacks on an individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities)</li>\n<li>Moderators or admins making verbal abuse, insults, threats towards others, or displaying offensive, derogatory, or explicit content.</li>\n<li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior.</li>\n<li>Selling a Partnered server or account is prohibited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a Discord Partner and a representative of Discord, you should be on good behavior on the Discord platform, across other social media platforms, and in real life. If we are made aware of situations where you are representing Discord poorly by, for example, violating other platforms Terms of Service or acting in a manner that is unbecoming of a Discord Partner, we may rescind the Partner status. We reserve the right to de-partner any community based on their behavior, both on and off of Discord, without warning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ii-adult-content-guidelines\">II. ADULT CONTENT GUIDELINES</h2>\n<p>Explicit pornographic content does not have a place in Partnered servers. This includes videos, gifs, or still images depicting explicit sexual actions, whether real or illustrated, as well as detailed verbal descriptions of explicit sexual acts. The Discord Partners Program is designed to highlight awesome communities and content creators and generally be welcoming to those of all ages. </p>\n<p>However, conversations around adult topics are allowed — we understand that there are Partnered servers that deal with sensitive and difficult topics, and we welcome those conversations and communities. In those servers, those channels should be clearly marked and opt-in. </p>\n<h2 id=\"iii-representations-and-misrepresentations\">III. REPRESENTATIONS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS</h2>\n<p>Servers are Partnered based on the content and community that they have at the point of application and for what that community is likely to grow into. That means that we expect your Discord will continue to be about the subject that you applied for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you (the partner) are a content creator, your server should be centered around <em>your</em> content. Switching to a community-based server will void your partnership. </li>\n<li>If you are a community server, your server’s focus should be the content that you applied for partnership under. Switching or repurposing the server from its original purpose will void your partnership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, we don’t appreciate a bait-and-switch. It’s totally understandable if you are a content creator and you change from one game to another, but it’s less reasonable if you’re a community around RPGs and one day you delete all channels and change to be about your personal interest in football, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>Finally, you (the partner) must maintain ownership of your partnered Discord server to stay in the program. If you delete or transfer ownership for any reason, without communication to Discord, your partnership and all Discord perks will be revoked. </p>\n<h2 id=\"iv-maintaining-quality-content-and-activity\">IV. MAINTAINING QUALITY CONTENT AND ACTIVITY</h2>\n<p>Content creators are expected to be creating <em>original</em> content. Complete copying or plagiarizing another party’s content will result in immediate removal from the partner program. </p>\n<p>We want our Partnered servers to be a good reflection of active Discord communities and users. With our new Partner requirements, all Partnered servers will receive an email and in-app warning when their server falls below the required threshold to maintain a partnership. The Partner will receive their first email five weeks after their server falls below the requirements. The final removal email will be sent after nine weeks of not passing the requirements. This means you have <strong>two months</strong> total to meet the criteria for partnership if you fall below it for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Finally, we understand that sometimes you have life events and/or you might not check in every day! If there’s something that’ll prevent you from being around for an extended period of time please let us know and we’ll see if we can work it out.</p>\n<h3>\n<em>Please note: </em>We have the right to update this Code of Conduct at any time, and as Discord evolves so may our expectations for our Partners. If this Code of Conduct does change, we'll be sure to communicate those changes to you (the partner) accordingly. </h3>\n<p>As a Discord Partner, always remember to conduct yourself in a responsible manner and treat others the way you’d like to be treated. We want to ensure that you are a shining example of the best parts of the platform and a prime example that other users should strive to be. <strong>Be the awesome you want to see in the world.</strong></p>"

What houses are there to pick from, you might ask? Well worry not new adventurer, for this article will prepare you for the battle that is ahead, but first, let us introduce the HypeSquad Houses:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360009331331/Screen_Shot_2018-08-16_at_2.28.06_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2018-08-16_at_2.28.06_PM.png\" width=\"655\" height=\"217\"></p>\n<h1 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\" style=\"color: #9c92e7;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">House of Bravery<br></span></strong></h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360042402651/Bravery.png\" alt=\"Bravery.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The universe needs people to lead the charge with confident optimism and tenacity. Without the brave, the HypeSquad would descend into chaos.</span></p>\n<h1 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red70\">House of Brilliance</span></strong></h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360042402691/Brilliance.png\" alt=\"Brilliance.png\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes patience and discipline to become a vital member of the universe.

Without balance, the HypeSquad would descend into chaos.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"this-sound-rad-how-can-i-join-a-hype-squad-house\"><strong>This sounds rad! How can I join a HypeSquad House?</strong></h2>\n<p>The process to join a House is easy! Just hop into User Settings, and you’ll see a new HypeSquad tab! You’ll have the option to take a five-question aptitude test and be placed in one of these three fabulous new houses. Go take the test for yourself and find out where you belong!</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you take the test to determine your fate, you’ll be an official member of the HypeSquad and be a part of our exclusive HypeSquad-only newsletter, along with being placed in one of the three HypeSquad Houses! Down the road, the Houses may even compete against each other for riches and prizes, so keep your eyes peeled!</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360009202092/HypeSquad_House_Info.png\" alt=\"HypeSquad_House_Info.png\" width=\"629\" height=\"588\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"i-was-already-a-hype-squad-online-member-but-my-badge-changed-its-color-what-does-that-mean\"><strong>I was already a HypeSquad Online member, but my badge changed its color! What does that mean? </strong></h2>\n<p>All existing HypeSquad Online members have been automagically assigned a house. If you think you’d be better suited for a different house, or you just really wanna take that test, you can head on over to User Settings in the desktop or web app, and select the shiny new “HypeSquad” tab!</p>\n<h2 id=\"im-not-quite-a-fan-of-my-house-can-i-join-another\"><strong>I'm not quite a fan of my House. Can I join another? </strong></h2>\n<p>You're welcome to retake the HypeSquad House placement test in User Settings &gt; HypeSquad! While you can't directly select a particular House, you can see which House you'd be placed in if you were to answer a bit differently!</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-wanna-take-my-hype-to-the-next-level-what-else-can-i-do-to-help\"><strong>I wanna take my Hype to the NEXT LEVEL! What else can I do to help?</strong></h2>\n<p>I’m stoked that you asked! If you wanna go the extra mile, you may be interested in becoming a HypeSquad Event Attendee or an Event Coordinator!</p>\n<p>Event Attendees help rep Discord in the real world, and we’ll even send them some free swag to wear and give away at events! Event Coordinators help run gaming events for their local organizations, schools or universities and qualify to receive a HUGE box of free Discord swag to give away, ranging from stickers, buttons and even free shirts!</p>\n<p>You can learn more about what we look for in Event Attendees and Hosts over at our <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003343812-HypeSquad-Event-Application-Requirements-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HypeSquad Event Application Requirements</a> page.

To have a sentence read in Text-to-Speech, just type <strong>/tts</strong> before your sentence. So, to read this sentence:</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>\"Discord's pretty awesome\"</strong></span></p>\n<p>Just type:</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>/tts Discord's pretty awesome</strong></span></p>\n<h3><em>Important Note: TTS follows the default system settings of how Discord is being used. Internet browsers such as Chrome or Firefox have a different Text-to-Speech reading bot than Windows or Mac do. Depending on what platform you're using, you'll be hearing different TTS voices!</em></h3>\n<h1>Make it stop!</h1>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We get it, the troll in your channel just had the TTS bot read \"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\"... Well, we have two selective methods to trim <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> channels have the privilege of utilizing TTS.</span></p>\n<h2>Method One: Notification Settings &amp; Server-Wide Mute</h2>\n<p>The first TTS toggle setting can be found here:</p>\n<p><strong>User Settings -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Text-to-Speech</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002556711/Text_to_Speech_1.PNG\" alt=\"Text_to_Speech_1.PNG\" width=\"601\" height=\"204\"></p>\n<p> You'll see three selections here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">For all channels</span>: This setting allows any channel, across any server, to have messages be read in Text-to-Speech,<strong> regardless if they use the /tts command or not.</strong> You'll be hearing a fair amount of TTS across all of your channels if you have this enabled. Use with caution!</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">For current selected channel:</span> This setting means the current text channel you have selected will have messages read in Text-to-Speech.</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Never</span>: No matter how hard your friends try, you won't ever hear the dulcet tones of the Text-to-Speech bot anywhere within Discord. (Unless you engage it yourself, of course.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Screen is particularly useful if you want to hear what your friends are typing. </p>\n<h2>Method Two: Read your own sentences!</h2>\n<p>The second TTS toggle setting can be found here:</p>\n<p><strong>User Settings button &gt; App Settings &gt; Accessibility</strong></p>\n<p>Use the Text to speech rate setting to adjust the speed at which the text is being read back to you.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4407495059863/Screenshot_96.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_96.png\"></p>\n<p>What this does is enable or disable the <strong>/tts </strong>command. If you have this option de-selected, and type in a <strong>/tts</strong> sentence the Text-to-Speech bot will not read it aloud. A sad tale indeed.</p>\n<h3><em>Important Note: The TTS option in the Accessibility tab is completely separate from the TTS options in the Notifications tab. If a user has TTS notifications enabled like in method one, they will hear your sentences written in TTS, regardless of what TTS settings you've selected. Similarly, if they disable TTS notifications, they won't hear your sentences read in TTS at all.</em></h3>\n<p>That wraps that up! We wish you the best in your robot adventures and hope that these tips will help you Discord!</p>"

Alt text is a short text description that you provide for your image, which is helpful for your friends or community who may be visually impaired and rely on a screen reader. Even for users that don’t need a screen reader, image descriptions are good to have for those with sensory/learning disabilities or in place of an image that doesn’t properly load in the browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GWWTJ313QZXE8KY5XS3HYN8G\">Desktop</h2>\n<p>After you choose the image you want to upload, press on the pencil icon to Modify Attachment at the corner of the upload preview.</p>\n<p>In the in-app pop-up, type in the Description (Alt Text) a brief description of your image.

Avoid repeating details.</li>\n<li>Don’t start the alt text with “image of…” or “picture of…” since screen readers will usually announce that an image is a “graphic” then state the provided alt text.</li>\n<li>Make sure to call out specific details. For example, state any text that’s in the image and the names of prominent figures, landmarks, etc. if they are in the image.</li>\n<li>Context is key! When describing the image, describe what the image is supposed to communicate to viewers, not just what is literally in the image.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>"

Some permissions can be as basic as allowing users the ability to add reactions to messages while other permissions grant users more administrative actions. These permissions are based on the roles assigned to users in a server and permissions can be assigned per role on both the server level and channel level.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01FFTVYFNVY8GHKTHCFBXMBGAZ\">How to Set Up Server Permissions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FFTVYQ38W9TVCTM6YZHZXFFA\">Step 1 - Create roles</h2>\n<p>Your journey to setting up permissions in your server begins with you creating roles!</p>\n<p>When you first create your server there is only one pre-made role: @everyone. The @everyone role defines the permissions that are enabled for everyone on your server even if they have no other roles assigned to them.</p>\n<h3>Note: As the creator of your server you don't need to assign any roles or permissions to yourself. You will always have access to everything.</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Press on the downward arrow next to the server name.</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Server Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Roles</strong> &gt; <strong>Create Role</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412259091351/Permission-Setup-Where-To-Create-Role-gif.gif\" alt=\"Permission-Setup-Where-To-Create-Role-gif.gif\" width=\"678\" height=\"340\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FFTVYZ40ZBHKZWTN1N8WPDTG\">Step 2 - Customize role and permissions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Give the new role a name. You can always change this later! Feel free to change the display of this role at this point, but for this article, we'll focus on Permissions.</li>\n<li>Select on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab of the new role you just created to see the list of server Permissions you can assign under this role.</li>\n<li>Make sure to consider what you want users in this role to do in your server when choosing permissions.</li>\n<li>Don't forget to <strong>Save</strong> the changes you're making to this role!</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412259091095/Create-Role-Permission-Setup.gif\" alt=\"Create-Role-Permission-Setup.gif\" width=\"686\" height=\"279\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FFTVZC9MSSMCG841X5JE482D\">Step 3 - Assign the role</h2>\n<p>Finally, once you've configured the role's permission, you can assign the role to members of your server.</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Select the <strong>Manage Members</strong> tab for the list of server members and pick the user you want to assign the role to.</li>\n<li>Or you can press on a user's avatar in the server then select the <strong>plus sign</strong> under the role section to select a role from the pop-up window</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412259093143/Assigning-Role-to-User-Plus-Sign-gif.gif\" alt=\"Assigning-Role-to-User-Plus-Sign-gif.gif\" width=\"686\" height=\"468\"></p>\n<p>Now this user has the server-wide permissions that you assigned to that role.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01FFTVZWZVQ3BZ0ZXRJ1QBCKY1\">Understanding Channel and Category Permissions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FFTW0BY5PDYV8YKSAWHJKR3T\">How to Set Up Channel Permissions</h2>\n<p>Now that you've set up roles with server permissions, it's important to understand channel permissions. Like server permissions, channel permissions allow specific users on how they can interact with a specific channel. Here's how to set up channel permissions.</p>\n<h3>Note: Channel permissions will override server permissions.</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>You can adjust permissions of specific channels, both text and voice, through the channel settings menu by hovering over a channel and clicking on the cog icon.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab on the left-hand side.</li>\n<li>By default @everyone has access to all features of a channel. You can allow or deny the permissions everyone has on this particular channel by clicking the check boxes.</li>\n<li>You can add roles or specific people whom you want to manage channel permissions for by clicking the <strong>plus sign</strong>.</li>\n<li>Once you have added a <strong>Role</strong> or member you can begin assigning channel permissions to this group or person.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FFTW0NHWARAWRYW17NY20AXA\">How to Set Up Category Permissions</h2>\n<p>In your server, you're also capable of adjusting Category permissions so that the channels under a category can all have the same permissions. Here's how you can set up Category permissions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right-click the category and choose <strong>Edit Category</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Permissions</strong> in the left-hand panel to alter permissions and add roles.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412259094551/Find-Category-Permissions-option.gif\" alt=\"Find-Category-Permissions-option.gif\" width=\"674\" height=\"338\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FFTW0XAAE10CGQXK6707JKTB\">Understanding Synced and Not-Synced Permissions</h2>\n<p>There are two default states for a channel in regards to category permissions: <strong>synced</strong> and <strong>not-synced</strong>. A synced channel will have permissions that completely match that of the category. A not-synced channel will have permissions that differ from the permissions set for the category.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412259094807/Synced-Channel-example.png\" alt=\"Synced-Channel-example.png\"></p>\n<h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">A synced channel!</h4>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412274201367/Not-Synced-Channel-example.png\" alt=\"Not-Synced-Channel-example.png\"></p>\n<h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">A not synced channel!</h4>\n<p>If you change the permissions on a category, all channels that are synced will automatically update.</p>\n<p>If you do not sync permissions when moving a channel between categories, or if you change an individual permission on the channel level, it will then show that the channel is not synced with the category.</p>\n<p>This means the channel currently does not share the same permissions as the category and will not automatically update when you make changes to the category's permissions.</p>\n<p>If you want a not-synced channel to sync with its category again, here's how you can do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right-click on the not-synced channel and choose <strong>Edit Channel</strong> from the drop-down menu.</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Permissions</strong> option in the left-hand panel.</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Sync Now</strong> button and the channel's permission will match the permissions of the category.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4412245350167/Syncing-Channel-Permissions.gif\" alt=\"Syncing-Channel-Permissions.gif\" width=\"691\" height=\"311\"></p>\n<h3>Note: Synced and not-synced channels can coexist within a category. Changing a category’s permissions will change all synced channel’s permissions, but not the permissions of any not-synced channel!</h3>\n<p>One final note on category permissions - if you don't want to utilize them at all, you can leave all channels within the category as \"not synced\" and manage them individually. Permissions can also be managed on a per-channel basis.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01FKP2FBYY22J5KP9BJ46W2VR9\">Learn more about how to use permissions</h1>\n<p>You can check out step-by-step instructions for the following popular permission settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206143407\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How do I set up a private server?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206143877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How do I set up a leaders channel?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/205369668\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How do I set up an announcements channel?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206141927\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How is the permission hierarchy structured? </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>"

Is it healthy? Are people talking? What's your retention look like? These are all questions that were hard or impossible to answer before. Now, they're easy, and come in pretty charts!</p>\n<h3>Quick note: Server Insights is an <strong>alpha feature</strong>, so there may be bugs!</h3>\n<h2 id=\"accessing-server-insights\">Accessing Server Insights</h2>\n<p>The ability to view this information is behind a new permission: <strong>View Server Insights</strong>. Granting someone in your server that permission will unlock the feature for them. Once unlocked, you can access Server Insights in a number of ways:</p>\n<p>1. From the server settings dropdown</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040262252/2.png\" alt=\"2.png\" width=\"356\" height=\"670\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">2. Within your server's settings</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040269091/1.png\" alt=\"1.png\"></p>\n<p>3. At <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.com/developers/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://discord.com/developers/servers</a> There, you'll see a list of servers in which you have permission to see insights. </p>\n<h1>What’s available</h1>\n<p>Growth and Activation: Where are new members coming from? Are they able to successfully talk? How many of them retain?</p>\n<p>Engagement: What are my members doing? How many people are talking? Which channels do people use the most?</p>\n<p>Audience: Where are my members from? How long have they been in my server?</p>\n<p>Announcement Channels: Analytics for your Announcement Channels (if enabled). <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more about Announcement Channels here</a>.</p>\n<p>Welcome Screen: Analytics for your Welcome Screen (if enabled) <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more about Welcome Screen here</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"data-privacy\">Privacy</h1>\n<p><strong>Your privacy comes first</strong>. That's why, along with aggregating and anonymizing what's shown in Server Insights, we've taken additional precautions to ensure that individual server members cannot be targeted.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you have a server with 100 members. No one from that server is located in the United States, so that country does not appear in your country breakout. The 101st member joins, and they <em>are </em>from the United States. How do we make sure that person can't be targeted as being from the United States?</p>\n<p>We do it like this, for a number of charts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Referrers: </strong>When you choose a date range for this chart, we calculate how many users joined your server from each referrer. Any referrer that has less than 50 joiners for the given time range will be combined into \"Other\" along with other referrers with less than 50 joiners.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Country Breakouts: </strong>For the given time range, if any country is represented by less than 50 members, those members will be bucketed into the \"Other\" category along with members from any other countries with less than 50 representatives.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Device Breakouts: </strong>For the given time range, any of the three categories—desktop, mobile, mixed—with less than 50 members will not be shown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not wish your activity in a Discord server to be included in Server Insights, you can opt out at any time by turning off this toggle in your account settings.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040453312/privacy.png\" alt=\"privacy.png\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Users that post in the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192\" target=\"_self\">Announcement Channels</a> will need to have <strong>Use data to improve Discord</strong> enabled in order for their announcement stats to show up in Server Insights’s Announcement Channel section.</h3>\n<h1 id=\"data-availability\">Availability</h1>\n<p>Server Insights are up-to-date as of one day in the past and will go as far back as 120 days for non-Partner and Verified servers. In some charts, it may not go back as far, as some data are only available starting from the day your server reached 500 members.</p>\n<p><br>For Partner and Verified servers, data can go back beyond 120 days, specifically, it will go back to the point at which your server was Verified or Partnered. So, if you got Partnered on May 1, 2018, you'll see charts starting on May 2, 2018.</p>\n<p><br>All dates and date ranges are represented in international UTC time. If you need help converting your timezone to UTC, <a href=\"https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here's a website</a>.</p>\n<p><br>Finally, we only show completed days, weeks, or months. This means that if you've selected Weekly or Monthly as your interval, and your starting date doesn't line up with the start of a week or month, you may miss some info.</p>\n<h1 id=\"dashboard-interactivity\">Dashboard Interactivity</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Interval: </strong>These charts can be aggregated in three different ways: daily, weekly, and monthly. \n<ul>\n<li>Hourly will be coming soon!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Date Range</strong>: You can specify a custom date range for the charts. This lets you view wide breadths of historical trends, or hone in on a very specific day.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Export CSV</strong>: You can export charts to CSV </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sorting</strong>: Tables with columns with numerical amounts can be sorted ascending or descending</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"you-are-now-prepared\">You Are Now Prepared</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">That's it! You've learned it all! You can come back to these charts at any time to see how your server is doing. We highly encourage you to experiment with ways to improve your server, now with the power to actually measure the impact.</p>"

Use (#) for a big header, (##) for a smaller header, or (###) for an even smaller header as the first character(s) in a new line to make a header. Here is an example of what each header type looks like.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850284963735\" alt=\"headers_example.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850287234583\" alt=\"headers_example_two.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H53FJBNB9B5RT9M1M9V1EQ7W\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Masked links</span></h2>\n<p>You can use masked links to make text a clickable or pressable hyperlink. To do so, you need to include the text you want displayed in brackets and then the URL in parentheses. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850326299287\" alt=\"link_example.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850327352599\" alt=\"link_example_two.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GY0ER08B6V1X2X9X6HT4HTGG\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Lists</span></h2>\n<p>You can create a bulleted list using either (-) or (*) in the beginning of each line. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850376284183\" alt=\"lists_example.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850329913751\" alt=\"lists_example_two.png\"></p>\n<p>You can also indent your list by adding a space before (-) or (*) at the beginning of each line. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850378577943\" alt=\"lists_indented_example.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850379795351\" alt=\"lists_indented_example_two.png\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GY0DAKGXDEHE263BCAYEGFJA\">Code Blocks</h1>\n<p>You can make your own code blocks by wrapping your text in backticks (`). </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850431807639\" alt=\"markdown_one_line.png\"></p>\n<p>If you want to create a multi-line code block, you can do so by wrapping your text in (```), like this beautifully written haiku.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850432625431\" alt=\"markdown_code_block.png\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GY0DBAPS5QAB5H7KBXKJZQTB\">Block Quotes</h1>\n<p>Another option is using block quotes. To use a block quote, you just need to put (&gt;) at the beginning of a line of text to create a single block quote. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850434263575\" alt=\"block_quotes_single.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850434958743\" alt=\"block_quotes_single_example.png\"><br>If you want to add multiple lines to a single block quote, just add (&gt;&gt;&gt;) before the first line. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850437179415\" alt=\"block_quotes_multi.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13850424579479\" alt=\"block_quotes_multi_example.png\"></p>\n<p>Now you're a Discord text markdown expert. Get out there and highlight your statements! </p>\n<h3>\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Spoilers is another type of formatting too! Using the syntax || around your text will mark it as a spoiler. Please note, this is negated by a code block.

Instead of needing to share a server with someone to send them a DM or check their status, the friends list gives you direct access to it. Here's a more detailed look:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">A lot going on there. Let's break it down piece by piece. Open up your friends list by clicking the icon above your server list. It'll happily highlight in blurple when you find it. </span></p>\n<h1><strong><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">THE FRIENDS LIST MENU</span></strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">This is where you'll sort the main friends list window. Each selection will adjust which friends you see in the window, as such:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">All:  All of your friends in one big window.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Online:  All of your friends who are online, not offline. You'll still see idle users.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Pending:  Anyone who's sent you a friend request. Don't leave them hanging!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Blocked:  All users who you've blocked. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #104c32;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Pro Tip: You can totally </span></strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0067e0;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">block users from sending you unwanted DMs</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"color: #104c32;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">.

Clicking the \"Add Friend\" button at the top will bring up this screen:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">1. Username    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Following that format, the end result should look like this:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Wumpus</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">(Yes, usernames are case-sensitive!)</span></p>\n<h1><strong><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">TUTORIAL BREAK:</span></strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">To grab it, click their avatar in the user list, or in the chat window:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Alternatively, if you don't like using that button, or you're super excited you found someone SO IMPORTANT that they need adding without leaving the screen, you can right-click their username/avatar, and you'll see a green \"send friend request\" button once you click \"profile\". Seriously, you can't miss it:</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #104c32;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Pro Tip: If you travel just a bit further down the right-click menu, you'll see the option to add your buddy directly in the menu.

In the three columns, you can see their name, status &amp; game playing, and what mutual servers you share.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">If you can't see your mutual servers, expand your window. They're there, they just like to hide if the window is too small.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #104c32;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Pro tip: Click on the horizontal bar next to any users name to be whisked to your DM screen with them. You can also click a server icon to be taken on a magical journey to that server's #general channel!</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">That about wraps up what we've got for the friends list so far. But just you wait, the party's just getting started.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img style=\"height: 416px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15080517297943\"></span></p>"

It could only be one thing- the search bar!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Alright, silliness aside, Discord's functionality as a forum and chat hub doubles as a pretty good archive as search enters the picture. The search function incorporates a few different tools and filters to help you find what you need in the smallest, friends only server, or an expansive community-wide server. Since Discord won't delete your messages until you decide to, you can refer to anything sent in your server as far back as when it was created! </span></p>\n<h1><strong><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Dust Off The Ole' Magnifying Glass</span></strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">To start searching, just click the search bar in the upper right-hand corner of the app. You can also hotkey your way to search success within the currently-viewed channel by pressing ctrl + F (Win) or cmd + F (Mac).

By filtering based on patterns instead of individual keywords, you can save time and effort from having to think of 50 variations of “free Nitro” that you’d want to filter out and adding each of them to your rules - instead, you could write a singular regex pattern that’ll do the same job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also makes regex an effective way to prevent people who try to bypass your keyword filters by intentionally misspelling words or using word variants, or block messages containing non-words like phone numbers, addresses (email, IP, physical), and that weird-lookin’ zalgo text.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10070021037975\" alt=\"image2.png\" width=\"590\" height=\"430\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10070015701271\" alt=\"image3.png\" width=\"590\" height=\"475\"></span>\n</h3>\n<h3><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue90\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For Example: </strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to block or receive alerts whenever someone posts a message containing an email address in your server?

The Rust regex crate supports the following flags:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">u</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> unicode</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">i</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> case insensitive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dot matches newline</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> multiline</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Case-insensitive and unicode support flags are on by default for every regex pattern. However, you can overwrite these flags or enable other flags by prefixing your regular expression with a modifier. The syntax to enable a modifier is: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(?a)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the syntax to disable a monitor is:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(?-a)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the flag you wish to enable to disable.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90\"><strong>Q: Do you have any examples of starter regular expressions?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Match all braille characters detailed in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this link here</a>!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[\\u2800-\\u28FF]+</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Match all Greek letters except beta:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[\\p{Greek}--β]+</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"gtx-trans\" style=\"position: absolute; left: 214px; top: 3054.08px;\">\n<div class=\"gtx-trans-icon\"> </div>\n</div>"

They can be shown always, or only while speaking.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img style=\"height: 124px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aTwBsKQzHOcEDovS38uDRLY3yVyO1M9dGNhPNZGEmFtOJOSqG-PY4uFgo0da4OJy-O9DbcK6mBp0xs7y_DykGlowx8NkJPor2ujr0WbRBUjUbX8z_zZUC1Zvppa807apSwJYQy0o7rYkNZ0BJtsUH04\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Always</strong> - Selected users will only be displayed as long as they are in the voice call or voice channel. If a user is also muted or deafened, an icon will be displayed next to their name.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693519320087\" alt=\"game_voice_chat_example_shown.gif\"></p>\n<p><strong>Only While Speaking</strong> - Users will only be displayed when they are actively talking or any audio is being picked up from their microphone.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693491658647\" alt=\"game_voice_chat_example_not_shown.gif\" width=\"302\" height=\"187\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H46HA58APNMH63PBFY9SZTBC\">Call</h2>\n<p>You can receive and answer calls with Game Overlay! You can answer a call by using your designated <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217083547\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">keybinding</span></a> or hovering your mouse over the incoming call and tapping on <strong>Join Call</strong> or <strong>Decline.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693519325847\" alt=\"game_overlay_incoming_call.gif\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H46HA9MPYS0VCSNS1ZE62Z6S\">Pinning</h2>\n<p>If you’re worried you’ll miss a message while battling monsters in a game, you can always pin a specific channel, direct message, or group message.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to make sure you have a keybinding for <strong>Toggle Overlay Lock</strong>. You can set this by going to <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Game Overlay</strong> and then setting your own custom keybinding, or use the default one.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img style=\"height: 100px; width: 350px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pK03OYsNxW3JBl9AmOBFoLWXHNI4xJkFGTGnGWyKvQQBz1oY7uj58HCrcqIku1VYIyosz_GXR-b_BennX7SQG-eZ0k63--0YiMFm11rkeglfKBxyIE1V-siX5aunDQIXqCdF3ko_zf5kjD9F_r-vlAo\"></strong></p>\n<p>1. Once you’ve set your own keybinding make sure the game overlay is turned on and go ahead and open a game of your voice. </p>\n<p>2. Press on your keybinding that you set (default is SHIFT+`) and that will pull up Discord. </p>\n<p>3. Navigate to your channel, DM, or group message of choice and press on the <strong>Pin </strong>icon to the left of the Search bar.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693519330839\" alt=\"game_overlay_pin.gif\"></p>\n<p>4. After being pinned you’ll see a new icon appear to the left of the Pin icon, this will help you with changing the Opacity of the Discord app. You can move the slider to the left to make it more opaque or right to make it less opaque. Once you’re happy with the setting, you can tap on the “x” to close the Opacity menu.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693491665943\" alt=\"game_overlay_opacity_slider.gif\"></p>\n<p>5. Next, you can resize the pinned window so it doesn’t interfere with your gameplay. While the game overlay is unlocked (SHIFT+` unless you set another keybinding for it) place your pointer over the bottom right of the chat window and then click and hold and drag it to your desired size. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693491669143\" alt=\"game_overlay_resize.gif\"></p>\n<p>6. You can also move the chat to anywhere on the screen by clicking and dragging on the chat window. </p>\n<p>7. You won’t be able to chat directly in the pinned message, however, you can respond to any message if you unlock the overlay (SHIFT+` or the keybinding you set). Tap the keybinding again or press outside of the Discord window to lock it back into place.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15693491670679\" alt=\"game_overlay_respond_in_pin.gif\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H46HAF4FF8TCARM43F4R0AHE\">Technical Issues with the Overlay</h1>\n<p>At the moment, the overlay is some pretty intense tech with a bit of arcane magic going on under the hood. Unfortunately, our various Anti-Virus software buddies haven't quite finished prodding Discord's files for the 100% good to go. Enabling the overlay might get Discord flagged by your Anti-Virus software. This is ok! We can <em>guarantee</em> it is a false positive. We're working with all the different companies to get Discord allowlisted.</p>\n<p>As you go into your software to add Discord to accepted processes, know that any file path that matches this one is 100% organic, certified, robograss-fed, homegrown Discord goodness:</p>\n<p>%appdata%\\discord\\0.0.***highest-number***\\modules</p>\n<p>(the ***highest-number*** refers to the latest version of Discord. Your path will have different text here.)</p>\n<p>You can allowlist files with that path with no problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H46HAME1PG4G7HRB32JGJW5S\">Less Compatible Games</h2>\n<p>There are some games that we know that do not work with the Discord Game Overlay. Unfortunately, if the overlay is not working with these games, there is nothing that we can do on our end and this is working as intended. Here is a list of known games: </p>\n<div>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Destiny 2</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Warface</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Arma 3</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">RuneScape</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Half-Life</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Minecraft Windows 10 Edition</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Dolphin</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Elsword</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Final Fantasy XIV </span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Killing Floor 2</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Roblox</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">SteamVR</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Forza Horizon 3</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">PokerStars</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Age of Empires II HD</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Paladins</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Archeage</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">PCSX2</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Fallout: New Vegas</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Street Fighter V</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Call of Duty: WWII</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Ragnarok Online</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Elite Dangerous</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">DayZ</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">PlanetSide 2</span></td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">There are a few other cases that overlay will not work with.

From having game nights with friends, to growing your communities, to creating things together--we know that all these things can be made better with apps.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789603003927\" alt=\"updated-App-Directory-recommendations.png\"></p>\n<p>These apps are a mix of community favorites and others we think you’ll love, including some made by companies we work with directly. Sometimes this may include a financial relationship; we’ll identify those apps to you in the Directory with a tag like \"Partner\". This does not include Premium App Subscriptions, as described below.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to check back regularly as we update the collections with new apps!</p>\n<h2>Browse by Category</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking for a certain type of app, you can also browse by category, as listed at the top of the homepage.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789638930711\" alt=\"updated-app-directory-categories.png\"></p>\n<p>Apps are sorted into relevant categories using a model informed by app names, descriptions, tags, and other information provided by developers, and results are listed in order of popularity based on the number of servers they’re in.</p>\n<h2>Browse by Searching Specific Terms</h2>\n<p>You can also search through the whole catalog of apps in the Directory using specific terms in the search bar.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789602958487\" alt=\"updated-Triva-search-results-app-directory.png\"></p>\n<p>Search results are generally determined using a model informed by app names, descriptions, tags, and other information provided by developers, and are listed in order of relevancy to the search term and popularity based on the number of servers they’re in.</p>\n<p>Results for some search terms, like music, may also be further filtered based on information provided by developers to offer greater relevancy and reliability—these result pages will look different than the standard list above.</p>\n<h1>App Product Pages</h1>\n<p>Each app in the Directory also has its own product page. There you’ll find useful information about the app (like what categories the app belongs to, where you can find the developer’s website and social accounts, popular slash commands, and so on) as well as a way to add the app to your server. There may even be an invite to a Discord server where you can try out the app or receive support. The developer of the app is responsible for its product page (e.g., the descriptions, images, videos, links, etc.), and ensuring it is accurate and up-to-date. If you have any questions or issues relating to the app or its product page, please reach out to the developer through their support channel.</p>\n<p>You may also notice that a few apps offer subscriptions to Premium Features you can purchase through Discord, offering you new levels of customization and functionality. Premium App Subscriptions are a new feature we are testing and rolling out slowly. <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9359445233303\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more here</a>.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of each app product page, you’ll find suggestions of similar apps you may also like. These suggestions are generated by a model informed by the app product page you’re on, including the categories the app is in, the other apps in those categories, and the number of servers the app is in.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GWTJQK4FGPJ5X7TCT27F0JTA\">Sharing Apps with Others</h1>\n<p>While Admins are responsible for adding an App to a server, anyone can share an app they love with others.</p>\n<p>To do so, you simply go to the specific app’s product page in the App Directory:</p>\n<p>1. Go to the App Directory following the instructions in the <a href=\"#h_01GFK7PTNE49GJ3GZEX5265EXQ\" target=\"_self\">Getting to the App Directory</a> section.</p>\n<p>2.

They are responsible for creating the tiers and their descriptions, and they also provide the subscriptions themselves and any associated content or other features. Please read the tier descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because these are a recurring subscription, we’ll charge you monthly until you cancel the subscription (which you can do any time as further described below).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unhappy with your Premium App Subscription, try contacting the developer of the app directly. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, you can request a refund <a href=\"#h_01GFK3DZ3PGJ0DKGE61VEK5J51\" target=\"_self\">as described below</a>. If you experience technical issues with Discord that prevent you from accessing your Premium App Subscription, reach out to us at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/billing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dis.gd/billing</a> and choose “<strong>Premium Apps</strong>” under Type of billing issue.

Read on to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GBAXETB4TVE2JPXG11AZ9W83\">WHAT ARE PRIVILEGED INTENTS?</h2>\n<p>While developers are responsible for their apps and data use, Privileged Intents were created as a way to help us protect you, our users, from potentially harmful apps that may try to misuse your data. We put up a privacy barrier between this data and potential bad actors. This data currently includes Member information (e.g., Server member lists or server joins/leaves), Presence information (e.g., server members’ status, or activities), and now Message Content (e.g., Content of messages in a server besides DM’s/mentions). In the right hands, however, this information can be used to create some super awesome tools to make your Discord experience even better! So, we’ve created a process for apps to request access to privileged intents. Large apps (in 100 or more servers) cannot access this data unless the developer goes through a screening process to determine eligibility based on the information they provide.</p>\n<p>To learn about privileged intents, <a href=\"#privileged_resources\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">here</a> are some excellent resources.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GBAXEERW0622BA0Q6CB70M6X\">But, I am not a developer… how does this new intent affect me?</h1>\n<p>If you are not a developer, you may be wondering how this affects you as a server owner or user. This should only affect you if you utilize verified apps. While unverified apps have a simple bot badge next to their name, a verified app will have a checkmark bot badge that looks like this one:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8424964707991/62857316414c2430b5f312c8_4444_command-buttons.png\" alt=\"62857316414c2430b5f312c8_4444_command-buttons.png\"></p>\n<p>If you currently use a verified app in your server(s), and they have not incorporated <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">application commands</a>, they may not work properly and some apps may not be able to be added to new servers. This is because they need to go through our <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6205754771351\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Privileged Intents verification</a> process or stop using the Message Content data in their app. Most verified apps have a support server where you can reach out to the developer with any questions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GBAXFSK2CNMHCRS168J5S8YM\">Using Application Commands</h1>\n<p>There are three ways of accessing the Application Commands:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GBAXTKQA3EJN5AXSNREKSHZ0\">1. COMMAND PICKER</h2>\n<p>Switching to application commands from prefix commands simplifies your Discord experience. Rather than typing<code>!</code> or some other prefix and trying to remember the name of all of the commands, now when you type <code>/</code> every command for all of the apps in the server should appear in an organized list called the Command Picker.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8424964707479/628572088b1d3cf52023fc2a_11111_command-picker.png\" alt=\"628572088b1d3cf52023fc2a_11111_command-picker.png\"></p>\n<p>This is much cleaner, more user-friendly, and there is a lot less channel spam from application commands!</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GBAXTSE93H2VVVZKHK15X5RW\">2. MESSAGE CONTEXT MENU</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Top-right menu or right-click on a message, go to Apps and choose a command directed at a specific message.</strong></em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8425006607639/d912a955d79aada8839222b2a12e4633.png\" alt=\"d912a955d79aada8839222b2a12e4633.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GBAXTZ1KR7ZPT7XAZMCDM3EQ\">3. USER CONTEXT MENU</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Right-click on a user, go to Apps, and choose a command directed towards a specific user.</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8425006586647/context_menu.png\" alt=\"context_menu.png\"></p>\n<h3>💡Accidentally start typing a command with a prefix out of habit?<br>No worries! We will suggest commands based on the words you type in. Check it out!</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8424964857367/slash_comm.png\" alt=\"slash_comm.png\"></p>\n<p>This will show you all of the commands containing the word that you start typing after the prefix for every app in the server!</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GBAXG0TWA8DE3114Y862EN02\">Server Owners and Admins</h1>\n<p>Make sure that you double-check your server’s app permissions. It’s likely that an app will no longer function if it was added to your server <em>before</em> they implemented the slash commands. These permissions are located in your server settings under <code>Integrations</code>. If you are still having issues, you can remove the bot and try adding it to your server with a new invite link. You can always reach out to the developers of the bot via their support server or website if they have one.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GBAXGAPKXTZ7T4NAX4GVSAQV\">Resources</h1>\n<h2>APPLICATION COMMAND RESOURCES:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PERMISSION TO SLASH, GRANTED: INTRODUCING SLASH COMMAND PERMISSIONS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WELCOME TO THE NEW ERA OF DISCORD APPS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"privileged_resources\">PRIVILEGED INTENTS RESOURCES:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Message Content Privileged Intent FAQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6207308062871-What-are-Privileged-Intents-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are Privileged Intents?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6177533521047\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is considered an acceptable use case for Privileged Intents?</a></li>\n</ul>"

As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">League</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackbox</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among Us</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q<strong>:</strong> Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: There is no age requirement for Know What I Meme.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select \"Know What I Meme\".</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I view my data for Discord-developed Activities? What data is accessed? What happens to the accessed user data?<br></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like Checkers in the Park through the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. To enhance the gameplay experience, Discord Activities access and temporarily store the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord ID</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avatar</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Username</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Activities played in a single session, user data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Activities that can be played across multiple sessions (like with Chess in the Park or Checkers in the Park), the user data above is retained. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Deleting your data will remove all of your progression across these Discord-developed activities.</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>\n<p>For instructions on how bug reports should be submitted, please see our Help Center article: <a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/bugs</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Q: My question isn't listed, what do I do?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all is lost, please submit a ticket to our support team at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/contact</a></span></p>"

As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: There is no age requirement for Bobble League.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select \"Bobble League\".</p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-8215fe56-7fff-c042-490b-a91ef0817a0a\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: How many players can play Bobble League?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: Bobble League is a game for 2-8 players. However, more members can join the activity as spectators and take part in subsequent games.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>\n<p>For instructions on how bug reports should be submitted, please see our Help Center article: <a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dis.gd/bugs</a> </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data?

If you’re ready to convert your server into a Community server, please check out this<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Help Center article</a> for a detailed guide on how to make the switch.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between Forums and Text channels?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: While Text channels are great for in-the-moment discussions, Forum channels provide a place for more drawn-out discussion around specific topics. Discussions are tied to individual posts so they are more organized and easier for members of your community to get up to speed and join a conversation.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between Forums and Threads?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: The main difference is that Forums are a type of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">channel</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while threads are a type of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">message</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While they are similar in that they both create dedicated spaces for organized discussions, Forum Channels are more persistent, while threads are more temporary.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What kind of tools are available to moderate Forum Channels?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: To ensure moderation of forum channels is easy and manageable, we’ve implemented 3 types of moderation support:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AutoMod</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Forum Channels are supported by AutoMod, our built-in moderation tool that helps detect and remove problematic content automatically.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow Mode: If the volume of posts and message activity is concerning, mods can place limits.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API: We’ve updated our</span><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/threads#forums\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> API Documentation</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so developers can integrate support for forums into their products.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there a way to close or lock a post in a forum channel?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: If a conversation has reached its end or you need to close it for any reason, you can right click the post and click Close Post. This will cause the post to no longer appear in the new posts section of the list and also lock the post so that only moderators can re-open it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s the best way to test forums with my community?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: While all communities are different, we recommend rolling out forums to your community gradually. This way, your community won’t experience big, jarring changes, and they’ll have time to get used to it. One example of a roll-out could look like this:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a private forum for you and your moderators to test and discuss plans</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify existing text channels where forums might be a good fit and replace them</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create new forum channels with the proper guidelines and tags</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make an announcement to inform your community about the changes and encourage them to provide feedback</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your community’s feedback is largely positive, identify larger “core” text channels that could benefit from the organization forums bring</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: How many posts can be pinned to the top? How long do they stay pinned?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Forum channels currently only support having one pinned post. Pinned posts aren’t on a timer, so they will remain pinned until it’s unpinned or another post is pinned (replacing the original pinned post).</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do you add or replace a thumbnail to a post?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: If you forgot to add a thumbnail to your original post, you can do so by being the first to reply to your original post with a photo. When you do this, the option to add the media to the original post will appear. If you select </span><strong>Add to Post</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it will append your media to the original post and act as the thumbnail.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I ping people within a forum channel? Will they be notified when a new thread is created with a ping in it?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes, you can ping people in a forum channel. They'll be able to continue receiving notifications if they're following that specific forum post! That is not the case for the forum channel as a whole. They won't be pinged for every new thread. Mentions in forum posts work in the same way as threads, which you can read more about in the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4403205878423#h_01F99ZCPB03MNQYYMHDFWQWR1E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Threads FAQ</a>.</span></p>"

It is located in your server notification settings. This setting operates independently of your server notification settings (<strong>all messages</strong>, <strong>@mentions only</strong>, or <strong>nothing</strong>). For example, you can have your server notifications settings set to <strong>Nothing</strong> and still receive Highlights notifications if the toggle is on. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17629501524759\" alt=\"highlights_settings.png\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17629501530007\" alt=\"highlights_settings_2.png\"></p>\n<p>Muting a server will turn off the Highlights toggle, and you will not receive any notifications from that server.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HAMZ2WJGFGGF2S3ZA257TD5F\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I turn on or off Highlights for all of my servers?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can turn Highlights on or off by navigating to the server notifications setting menu and enabling <strong>Suppress Highlights</strong>. Currently, these settings can only be changed one server at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are Highlights personalized to me?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the information that Discord uses to determine if something is considered a Highlight might depend on your activity on Discord, along with details about the server or channel. Discord relies on information such as how often you visit a server, the number of reactions to a post, or the number of attendees at an event in a server. </p>\n<p>At any point in time, you may choose to turn on or off this personalized experience on Discord via <strong>the personalization toggle in your </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004109911-Data-Privacy-Controls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Privacy &amp; Safety settings</a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17629481305751\" alt=\"data.png\"></p>"

Play as many or as few courses as you want!<br>Tournament Mode lets you pick the number of courses to play - either 3, 6, or 9 courses, each with six holes.

If the app has commands registered in your server, you’ll see a list of commands and ways to control access to them!</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>How do I restrict who can use commands?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Under “Roles and Members” you’ll see a list of who currently has permissions to use commands. You can make changes by changing the toggle, just like other permissions, or adding additional roles and members.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>How do I turn commands off within specific channels?</strong></span></p>\n<p>We know that servers have different needs, and you may want to restrict commands to certain channels. By default, commands are available in all channels. This means <strong>when you add a new app to your server, all members will be able to use any commands</strong>, unless the developer has set up default member permissions.</p>\n<p>To restrict access to certain spaces, click ‘Add Channels’ and select additional channels to customize. Toggle permissions off as desired.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>How can I see what an app’s commands are?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Knowing what commands are available - before making them visible and accessible to the broader members of a server - is a good way for moderators and admins to feel confident about keeping their server clean, safe, and botspam-free.</p>\n<p>You can see a list of commands right on the Command Permissions page. Use the Search bar to see if the app has a command you’re looking for - and use the filters for more refined results.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Can I change permissions for a specific command?</strong></span></p>\n<p>You can make changes to individual commands by creating overwrites. Clicking a command in the list will open a popup where you can make changes.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12792358198807\" alt=\"change-updated-permissions-for-specific-command.png\"></p>\n<p>Here we have an app called StudyBot. By default, we only want the \"Student Leads\" role to be able to use its commands, and only in #study-zone.</p>\n<p>However, we also want the \"Study Buddies\" role to be able to use a specific command, <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" style=\"font-weight: 600;\" data-token-index=\"1\">/notecards</span>. We also want that command to be usable in #flashcard-help.</p>\n<p>With these overwrites, <strong>/notecards</strong> can be used</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By Study Buddies <em>and</em> Student Leads</li>\n<li>In #flashcard-help <em>and</em> #study-zone</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>How do default member permissions work?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Some apps have default restrictions on their commands when they’re added to a server, called “default member permissions”. We don’t want everyone to be able to ban each other before we get our app set up properly!</p>\n<p>These permissions are set by the app’s developer. This is what it looks like when a command has default member permissions.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12792394104599\" alt=\"command-with-default-permissions.png\"></p>\n<p>In some cases, you may want to change access on top of these defaults. Let’s use the following example:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12792399288983\" alt=\"change-access-plus-change-default-permissions-for-command.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>/study</strong> has a default restriction on it: only members with “Manage Channel” can use it. This impacts the “Student Leads” who can use the entire application as well; only Student Leads <em><strong>with Manage Channel</strong></em> can use <strong>/study</strong>.</p>\n<p>We can add the above overwrites to also grant “Study Buddies” access. With the above configuration, <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" style=\"font-weight: 600;\" data-token-index=\"1\">/study</span> can be used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By Student Leads <em>who also have Manage Channel</em>\n</li>\n<li>By Study Buddies, <em>regardless of whether they have Manage Channel</em>\n</li>\n<li>In #flashcard-help and in #study-zone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we wanted <em><strong>all</strong></em> Student Leads to have access to <strong>/study</strong>, we can add them as an additional overwrite:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12792438892951\" alt=\"add-additional-overwrite-for-command-permission.png\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"notion-enable-hover wysiwyg-font-size-large\" style=\"font-weight: 600;\" data-token-index=\"0\">I’m a developer.

Some filters, like Keyword Filters, are configurable so you can have AutoMod automatically detect and block messages containing specific words or phrases you find harmful to your Community before they’re even posted. Other filters we’re building are powered by machine learning algorithms to detect and block harmful or dangerous messages, such as links to malware.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974156206103\" alt=\"automod_example.png\"></p>\n<p>AutoMod prevents unwanted messages from being posted in your Community across all of your #text-channels, along with other messaging surfaces like threads and text chat in voice channels. This way, you can feel more comfortable providing your Community with more ways to talk and interact with each other without worrying about adding more moderation work onto your plate. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><br><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974178178327\" alt=\"automod_systemmessage.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">You can also choose to have AutoMod send you alerts containing who-what-where information about blocked messages to a dedicated, private channel of your choice to help you identify and act on potential bad actors and unwanted behavior within your Community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GV3GPTD3NTNMY5TCQCFX4X6Z\">WHAT IS AUTOMOD AI?</h1>\n<h3>\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">This feature is in alpha for a small % of servers.

Commonly Flagged Words Rule - Use ready-made word lists to filter commonly flagged words</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">2. Custom Keywords Rule - Build your own list of keywords and terms to filter in your Community </span></p>\n<p>We understand it can be tough and time-consuming to think of all the words you’d want to filter out from scratch while also moderating a Community. To get started with AutoMod, you can quickly set up a Commonly Flagged Words rule to enable ready-made word lists that protect your Community from exposure to messages containing commonly flagged words at the push of a button:</p>\n<p><strong>Categories of Commonly Flagged Words:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Insults and Slurs </strong>- Protect members of your Community from personally insulting material targeted at them, including terms that may be considered slurs or hate speech.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sexual Content</strong> - Keep sexually explicit language out of your server to keep your Community family-friendly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severe Profanity</strong> - Block the more egregious forms of profanity, while still allowing for mild forms of cursing or swearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974312213271\" alt=\"image4.png\"></p>\n<p>Because every Community has their own standards on what words are deemed acceptable, you’ll have the ability to exempt words from these lists! Exempted words will no longer be flagged and will not receive a response from AutoMod.

These new filters help address message activity that negatively impacts the members in your Community by allowing you to block messages containing spammy text content before they’re ever posted.</p>\n<p>With AutoMod’s Spam filters, you can enable the two rules below to protect your Community against different types of spam. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">You can also choose how AutoMod will respond when a message triggers your rules.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Block Spam Content Rule - Enable this rule to detect messages containing unwanted spammy text content that disrupts your experience on Discord such as:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Unsolicited messages or advertisements (free Nitro)</li>\n<li>Invite spam</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note this filter is powered by machine learning that is informed by spammy messages users have previously reported to us - turning on this AutoMod filter will flag messages with similar qualities. This filter is not perfect so it might not catch everything that you may consider spam; for example, nonsensical words across multiple messages or “copy/pasta” messages. </p>\n<p>We will monitor user feedback to improve this filter over time, so help us out: if you come across a message that was incorrectly flagged as spam, click the “Report Issues” button below the flagged message to let us know.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Block Mention Spam Rule - Set a limit on the number of mentions a message may contain. Once configured, AutoMod can detect and block messages containing excessive user or role mentions and help prevent your members from receiving unnecessary notifications and pings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>HOW TO SET UP SPAM FILTERS FOR AUTOMOD</h2>\n<p>To start setting up your own rules for Block Spam Content or Block Mention Spam, go to <strong>Server Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>AutoMod</strong> to see the different spam filter options:</p>\n<p><strong>How to Set Up the Block Spam Content Filter</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press “Set Up” or enable the toggle button on the Block Spam Content filter to view the different response actions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974672241431\" alt=\"automod_spam.gif\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Choose to have AutoMod block flagged messages entirely, and/or send you an alert:<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974704497815\" alt=\"automod.png\"><br>Block message and send an alert for flagged messages</li>\n<li>(Optional) Add exempt roles or channels that you don’t want AutoMod to flag for suspected spam content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a reminder, setting a channel to be exempt will ensure that any messages in Threads and Text Chat in Voice in that particular channel will also be exempt.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974705964183\" alt=\"automod_allow.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>How to Set Up the Block Mention Spam Filter</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press “Set Up” or enable the toggle button on Block Mention Spam to view the different response actions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974708184471\" alt=\"automod_mention_spam.gif\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Set a limit on the number of mentions that a message may contain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974710092439\" alt=\"config_limits.png\"><br>Set a mention limit, up to a maximum of 50 per message</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Choose to have AutoMod block messages, send you an alert, and/or time out users when it flags a message containing excessive mentions. </li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974731626391\" alt=\"block_message.png\"><br>Block message, send an alert, and/or timeout user for flagged messages</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>(Optional) Add exempt roles or channels where you don’t want AutoMod to flag messages containing excessive mentions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a reminder, setting a channel to be exempt will ensure that any messages in Threads and Text Chat in Voice in that particular channel will also be exempt.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974746646935\" alt=\"allow_certain.png\"><br>Add exempt roles or channels</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GV3HBH7412D01VKF9EKHEMA2\">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: Who has access to AutoMod at this time?</strong><strong><br></strong>A: <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5493223c-7fff-12fb-3655-82fc39aaaa4d\">AutoMod is currently available for all servers.</span><br>This means you must have Community enabled from your server’s settings to access AutoMod. Learn How to enable your Community Server <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What filters are currently available under AutoMod?</strong><strong><br></strong>A: Currently, the Keyword filters and the Spam Content filter are available and ready to use. We will continue working on additional content filters which will be added to AutoMod when ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What languages does AutoMod support?</strong></p>\n<p>A: AutoMod can detect words and phrases in any language from your Custom Keyword Rules.<br>However, the word lists of Commonly Flagged Words, as well as the Spam Content filter, are currently only available in English.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What kinds of things can AutoMod detect from my custom rules?</strong></p>\n<p>A: AutoMod can detect and filter words and characters in English and other languages, links, emojis*, punctuation, and symbols that you enter in your Custom Keyword Rules. <br><em>*Note that you are not able to add custom emojis from other servers that you don't have access to into your Custom Keyword rules.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Who can make updates to AutoMod in my server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Those with “Manage Server” or “Administrator” permissions will be able to access, create, and edit your AutoMod rules when on a Desktop device. Updates to your AutoMod rules cannot be made on mobile devices at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How does keyword matching work?</strong><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p>A: AutoMod will block messages that contain keywords found anywhere in the message, including between words. This can be useful for reducing toxicity, or protecting against spam bots and targeted harassment.</p>\n<p>When you add a term consisting of multiple words to a rule, only messages that contain the exact term will be blocked. For example, adding “this is bananas” as a term will only block messages containing “this is bananas,” not those that contain only “this” or “is bananas.” </p>\n<p>The number of terms you can enter in each Custom Keyword Rule is capped at 1,000 with a 60 character limit for each term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do wildcards work?</strong></p>\n<p>A: By default, AutoMod scans for messages containing keywords that are an exact match to those in your rules. But chances are you’ll run into people in your Community trying to circumvent your rules and get harmful messages in circulation. So how can you block all kinds of words that partially match your keywords too? </p>\n<p>That’s where wildcards come into play. When setting up your Custom Keyword Rules, you can append the * wildcard character to your keywords which allows you to filter out word variations that partially match your keywords.</p>\n<p>Simply add the * character at the beginning or the end of a keyword to select one of the following matching strategies on a per keyword basis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prefix -- at least one word in the message must start with keyword</li>\n<li>Suffix -- at least one word in the message must end with keyword</li>\n<li>Anywhere -- keyword can show up in any part of the message in the middle of any word</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Examples: <br>cat* ⇒ get a <strong>cat</strong>-sitter <br>*cat ⇒ cool bob<strong>cat</strong> <br>*ana* ⇒ b<strong>ana</strong>nas</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will AutoMod work on Threads and Text Chat in Voice channels?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes! When containing a keyword or term from your rules:<br>1. Threads are not created</p>\n<p>2. Messages within a Thread or Text Chat in Voice channel can be blocked and sent as an alert</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will AutoMod flag messages from bots?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No - all bot alerts and messages will be exempt from AutoMod.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I have the Commonly Flagged Words rule enabled - why am I still seeing undesirable words?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Our Commonly Flagged Words filters are designed to provide every Community with a quick and effective way to set up defenses against commonly flagged keywords so you don’t have to think about them yourself and build from scratch.</p>\n<p>However, we understand every Community has their own rules and tolerance for certain words. Some communities prefer to maintain a more family-friendly environment, while others accept and encourage rowdier language. And oftentimes it’s not the word itself that causes harm, but the intent with which it’s being used.</p>\n<p>Because of these considerations, our Commonly Flagged Words filters may not catch everything. For words that we don’t catch, you can add them to any of your Custom Keyword Rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I see all the words that the Commonly Flagged Words filters contain?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We understand you want to see the words in these word lists to decide whether they’ll be effective at providing coverage against language you want to filter out, without stifling conversations in your communities. </p>\n<p>However, for the time being we will not publicize words in these word lists in order to maintain their protective efficacy. This is to ensure those with malicious intent can’t easily develop means to circumvent them in communities that use them.<br>We value providing transparency into the thinking that went into making these word lists, and will address those topics in a future post on our blog.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will the Commonly Flagged Words filters be updated over time?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes - we recognize that language is fluid and always evolving, and the words of today may not carry the same meaning tomorrow. We’ll continue to explore ways to offer communities further customization with our filters, and will regularly refine them using your reports and feedback.</p>\n<p>To share your feedback with us, click “Report Issues” on any of your AutoMod alerts containing the word you’d like to flag to us.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974787119895\" alt=\"automod_alert.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What types of spam does the Block Spam Content filter not catch?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The spam filter will flag text content that has been reported to us as spam by our users, and thus may not flag everything that may be considered spam such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unwanted spammy text content repeated across multiple messages and channels</li>\n<li>Friend request spam</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: I found spam that Discord missed, what should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you encounter content that was incorrectly flagged as spam, click “Report Issues” on any of your AutoMod alerts of flagged spam content. This will help us improve the filter’s accuracy over time.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12974788285207\" alt=\"reportmessage.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How will Discord use my feedback on the Block Spam Content filter?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We will be working to improve the spam filter over time by continuously reviewing user reports. As a reminder, when you report a message, you are sending the content of the flagged message to Discord.</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-478c11e4-7fff-cc33-e6ce-7619340ec94e\">Q: What does OpenAI know about me?</span></strong></p>\n<p>A: AutoMod is a Discord service so any data it uses is governed by our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Privacy Policy</a>. When you use AutoMod, it will access certain information such as messages flag content. OpenAI is our vendor, meaning they may only use this information at our direction; they may not use it to train their general AI models.</p>"

Of course, everything needed to stay super-secret at the time, so we couldn’t share anything quite yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But your daydreams of Squares, Triangles, and Circles swirling in the sky are over as the news drops now: </span><strong>Starting today, we're gradually rolling out the ability to link your PSN account from Discord and display your PlayStation®4 or PlayStation®5 game activity in your user profile! </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve ever connected your Discord account to another service that allows you to display your activity, it works similarly here: once your Discord account is linked, the game you’re currently playing on either PS4™or PS5™ will be shown as your activity, just like that! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can even opt to display your PlayStation™Network online ID on your profile so your Discord friends can add you and tag along. It’s especially great for knowing if your friend is currently playing a game that supports cross-play on another platform. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t see the option quite yet?

For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>\n<p>For more information about Activities on Discord, go <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>!</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: There is no age requirement for Blazing 8s</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select \"Blazing 8s\".</p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-6d410d15-7fff-493e-8203-9d1ac12caab6\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: How many players can play Blazing 8s?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: Blazing 8s is a game for 2-5 players. However, more members can join the activity as spectators and join the queue to play in future hands.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>\n<p>For instructions on how bug reports should be submitted, please see our Help Center article: <a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/bugs</a> </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Checkers in the Park</em> through the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span>To enhance the gameplay experience, Discord Activities access and temporarily store the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discord ID</li>\n<li>Avatar</li>\n<li>Username</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Activities played in a single session, user data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained.</p>\n<p>For Activities that can be played across multiple sessions (like with Chess in the Park or Checkers in the Park), the user data above is retained. </p>\n<h3>Note: Deleting your data will remove all of your progression across these Discord-developed activities.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: My question isn't listed, what do I do?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: If all is lost, please submit a ticket to our support team at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/contact</a></p>"

At the discretion of the creator/admin of the server, membership can be divided into tiers; each tier may have unique pricing and perks.</p>\n<p>Creators/server admins provide the premium membership. They are responsible for creating the tiers and their descriptions, and they also provide the subscriptions themselves and any associated content or other perks. Please read the tier descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</p>\n<p>Because these are recurring subscriptions, you’ll be charged monthly until you cancel the subscription (which you can do anytime from the Premium section in User Settings).</p>\n<p>If you are unhappy with your Server Subscription, contact the creator/server admin directly. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, you can request a refund as described below. </p>\n<p>If you experience technical issues preventing you from accessing your Server Subscription, contact us at<a href=\"http://dis.gd/billing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> dis.gd/billing</a> and choose <strong>Server Subscription</strong> under <strong>Type of billing issue</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GXS8AFVQFQYKC26D6E89516Z\"><strong>HOW CAN I SUBSCRIBE TO A SERVER SUBSCRIPTION IN A SERVER?</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>In the server you would like to have a Server Subscription, you can press \"Server Subscription\" at the top of the server's channel list. </li>\n<li>An in-app landing page will appear, and you can see the different Server Subscription  subscription tiers, their prices, and the perks included in each tier. Read the descriptions to make sure you know what you’re buying!</li>\n<li>Choose a tier, then follow the instructions to pick a payment method and complete the purchase.</li>\n<li>And that's it! A welcome message will pop up to show you the perks you have with the Server Subscription tier you purchased.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GXS8QJ43BG0RDFEJ2P56Z0H9\"><strong>HOW DO I MANAGE OR CANCEL MY SERVER SUBSCRIPTION WITH A SERVER?</strong></h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Press on the cog wheel next to your username at the bottom right corner of the client to open up User Settings.</li>\n<li>Select Subscriptions on the left side panel.</li>\n<li>On this page, you should see your subscriptions, including memberships. Press on the Manage Membership button.</li>\n<li>The Server Subscription page will show your memberships across all servers and each memberships' costs and billing/renewal dates. Press on Cancel Subscription next to the membership you want to cancel and confirm your decision!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GXS8QWVJXBH1PJ4KP942M5PM\"><strong>CAN I ASK FOR A REFUND FOR MY SERVER SUBSCRIPTION?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you would like to refund a Server Subscription purchase, you must first contact the server owner.</p>\n<p>You can also review our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refund Policy</a> for refund eligibility criteria and instructions on requesting a refund.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GXS8R35VE6J7YE50ZPR239CQ\"><strong>WHY CAN’T MY SERVER ENABLE SERVER SUBSCRIPTIONS?</strong></h1>\n<p>For more information on Server Subscription eligibility, please see<a href=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/articles/10423011974551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this link here</a>!</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01GXS8R9AVGAC8PRKTB13D53ZD\">Server Subscriptions iOS </h1>\n<p>Server Subscriptions can now be purchased on mobile (iOS)! Support your favorite creators and communities by subscribing directly from the Discord iOS app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GXS8RFFFKYZ1CGYAC0BZZ6MD\">Frequently Asked Questions for iOS</h2>\n<p><strong>Q. Do mobile subscriptions cost the same as desktop subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. Apple takes an additional 30% of revenue from all subscriptions initiated through the Discord iOS application. Subscribers on iOS mobile devices will see a higher price on iOS checkout to account for the additional iOS fee. </p>\n<p>More information on the fee structures is available in the Monetization Terms: <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms</a></p>\n<p><strong>Q. Can I change (upgrade or downgrade) my current tier mid-month on iOS?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Currently, we do not support upgrading or downgrading your tier mid-cycle if the subscription was initiated on the Discord iOS app.</p>\n<p>However, you can cancel your subscription, wait for it to end, and then purchase the new tier you want. For example, if you have a subscription to tier A that renews on March 24, but you want to purchase tier B, you will need to cancel tier A, and wait for the subscription to end on March 24 — then you will be able to purchase tier B.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will subscriptions be purchasable on Android?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We’re working on it! We don’t have any timing to share at this point but we are actively working to bring Server Subscriptions to Android mobile devices.</p>"

Lastly, press <strong>Create Event </strong>and you should be good to go!!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15201050259607\" alt=\"stage_event_dropdown.gif\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"docs-internal-guid-9499c3d9-7fff-3444-3e28-40982df33df4\"><strong>How do I start, edit, or cancel an event?</strong></h1>\n<p>When you want to start an event, you can go to the <strong>Events</strong> option in the server's channel list, opening the in-app pop-up window, pressing the ellipses under the desired event, and selecting <strong>Start Event</strong>. This will send out a notification to all your server members who marked themselves as <strong>Interested</strong> to attend the event.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">In order to start, edit, or cancel any events created by another individual, you will need to have the server-wide or channel-specific Manage Events permission enabled. However, if you happen to have Create Events permissions enabled, you will only be able to update events you have created.</span></h3>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-0e4a6768-7fff-929c-dc25-623650359ed6\">If your event does not start within an hour of the scheduled time, our system will automatically remove your event from the list of Scheduled Events for your Community.</p>\n<p>If you would like to edit or cancel an event, you can do so by pressing on the <strong>Events</strong> section in the server's channel list then pressing on the ellipses under the event that you would like to edit or delete.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> <img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15201050268823\" alt=\"event_options.gif\"></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-4ce26cc6-7fff-83c7-f30a-04814fb7264b\"><strong>How Does Link Sharing Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are two types of event sharing links:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Event<strong> Server Invite Links:</strong> these work similar to a server invite link, except it renders a special Event Embed in the Discord app that has event details and a button to RSVP. Users who aren’t in the server will be able to select this invite and join the server.</li>\n<li>Direct<strong> event links:</strong> these operate similar to message links. They will directly link you to the event and will only work if you have permission to see the event. If you’re not in the the server the link will not work.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Note: Only users with Invite Permissions can generate Event Server Invites. Events in private channels cannot generate Event Server invites and will default to Direct event links.</strong></h3>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H2H6RP7CX5VFTE81M8M982NT\"><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if an event takes place in a voice channel with restricted access?</strong></p>\n<p>A: For events in restricted voice channels, only users with the right role/permissions to that channel can potentially attend the event and see the scheduled event in the <strong>Events </strong>option of the server's channel list.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will this be available on all platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Our mobile platforms may take longer to rollout, but will be available across all platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What channels can I schedule events for?</strong></p>\n<p>A: At this point in time, events can be scheduled for Private Stages, Voice Channels, and there is a free form field for any additional place (e.g. physical location, text channel, etc) that you are hosting an event.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens when I press on the \"Interested\" button for an upcoming event?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When you press on \"Interested\" for an event, you'll be letting the event host know that you'd like to attend and you'll also receive a notification when the event is officially live! You can also retract the notification reminder by re-pressing and retracting your interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I forget to start my own event (as an event owner/host)?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If your event does not start within 8 hours of the scheduled time, our system will automatically remove your event from the list of Scheduled Events for your Community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why should I even schedule an event?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Events essentially provide your Community the opportunity to receive advanced notice for things happening in the server! Community members also receive a notification when the event goes live if they're \"Interested\" in the event, which helps ensure no one misses it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When do I need to schedule events by?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There's no specific time limit to how far in advance an event must be created. As long as the event hasn't yet started, you'll be able to schedule one for your Community!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many scheduled events can a server have?</strong></p>\n<p>A: At this point in time, there's a cap of 100 scheduled events that can take place in a server at one point in time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What permissions do I need to schedule an event?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Events require a specific permission for creating, starting, editing, and deleting. The \"<strong>Manage Event</strong>\" permission can be enabled by going to <strong>Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Edit Role &gt; Permissions &gt; Manage Event</strong>.</p>\n<p>If hosting an event in a Stage Channel, you will need to be a Stage Mod for the channel. If hosting an event in a Voice Chat channel, you can have just the channel-specific Manage Event permission or the server-wide Manage Event permission as well as the other channel-specific permissions, such as View, Speak, and Connect.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can't I share an event?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The permissions for sharing events are tied to creating invite links. If a user has permissions to invite other users to the channel, they will also have permissions to share events tied to that channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When does the Event tab show up in my server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: For Community servers, the Event tab will always show for users with the “Manage Events” permission. It does not show to anyone else unless there is an upcoming event.</p>"

In Watch Together, everyone can participate in building a playlist of videos. Watch Together will handle the video syncing for you - no counting down to pressing play!</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"docs-internal-guid-6a60ad9f-7fff-8316-5009-b462a7356772\">HOW TO USE WATCH TOGETHER</h1>\n<p>There are many different ways you can launch Watch Together in the Discord app for you and your friends! Whether in a server’s voice channel or in a direct message, you can check out <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activities on Discord</a> for instructions on how to start any Activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-0000702c-7fff-036f-ac93-404a0f816764\">GETTING STARTED</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #4f545c;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Once you've acknowledged YouTube’s user agreements and authorized Watch Together to access your Discord account, you can begin watching videos!</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532804363287\" alt=\"image4.png\" width=\"435\" height=\"521\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532804366359\" alt=\"image3.png\" width=\"417\" height=\"755\"></p>\n<p>To add videos to the shared playlist, select a trending video, paste a YouTube video link into the search bar, or enter a search term.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532779894551\" alt=\"image1.gif\"></p>\n<p>As soon as there are videos in the playlist, they will begin autoplaying in order.</p>\n<p>Participants in the session can continue adding videos to the playlist throughout the Watch Together session.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H3MK3TZ9HGJB4SQ2R2C73BC7\">WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HOSTING OR SHARING?</h2>\n<p>By default, the person who started Watch Together is Hosting, and they control what’s playing. In hosting mode, anyone can add videos to the playlist, but only the host can pause, scrub, skip, reorder, and delete any video.</p>\n<p>If the host wants others to be able to control the video, they can toggle to Sharing mode. When sharing, all participants have controls over the playlist and the current video, and their actions apply to every user in the session. We recommend Hosting when in big groups and Sharing when in small groups!</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H3MK4130BCR8XS4ATP01PGCA\">IF I CHANGE THE VOLUME, DOES IT CHANGE EVERYONE ELSE'S VOLUME?</h2>\n<p>Volume changes are always local, so if any user adjusts the volume or mutes the YouTube player, only their own audio is affected.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">When using Watch Together on desktop, you can adjust the video volume within the video itself using the volume slider in the video or by adjusting your device’s volume. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532779896087\" alt=\"ezgif.com-optimize(2).gif\"></p>\n<p>On mobile, the volume icon in the video window can only mute or unmute the sound. To control the volume, you need to adjust your device’s volume.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H3MMTBMTC0RSGHAARRJRS18X\">PLAYBACK</h2>\n<p>Playback of videos is limited to 180 minutes if watching with a group or 30 minutes if watching alone. When the max playback limit is reached by an individual user, playback will end for that user. This will start a 10-minute cool-down, after which you can continue watching. This same timer applies no matter what server or voice chat you are in. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the video will continue playing for viewers who have not reached their playback limit. If you are Hosting and hit your playback limit, Watch Together will automatically assign Host to someone who has not reached their playback limit.You do not reclaim Host status when your cooldown timer runs out.</p>\n<p>If you do not interact with Watch Together for 30 minutes, your session will be paused until you interact with WT again. If you are Host and you hit your inactivity limit, Watch Together will not reassign host to another user. </p>\n<h1 id=\"docs-internal-guid-05499c68-7fff-ee00-ab44-1a3a61556529\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: If I pause the video, does it pause for everyone else?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When the remote is not shared, only the Host can pause the video. When the remote is shared, anyone can pause the video.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I hide the Activity Launcher or remove the activity from my server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you have the admin permission in your server, you can hide the Activity Launcher for certain roles. To do this, go to Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Permissions &gt; Voice Channel Permissions and toggle off the \"Use Activities\" permission.</p>\n<p>You can also hide the Activity Launcher for a channel category or specific voice channel by right-clicking and going to Voice Channel Permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I change this activity to my preferred language?</strong></p>\n<p>A: This Activity is currently available only in English, but you can search for videos in different languages within the YouTube player.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can’t I hear the video’s audio?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">A: Watch Together plays audio through your operating system's audio output device. Your operating system's audio output could be different from your Discord audio output. If you are hearing the voices of other people in a call, but you're not hearing the audio from videos in Watch Together, it means you have set your Discord audio output to a different device than your system audio output.</span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\"><br></span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">To change the audio output for Watch Together, you'll need to change the audio source selected for your operating system. To find and update your operating system's audio output, look for the speakers icon in the Taskbar on Windows, or in System Preferences on a Mac.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">A: </span></strong><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to </span><a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">For instructions on how bug reports should be submitted, please see our Help Center article: </span><a href=\"https://dis.gd/bugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/bugs</a><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: We’re always looking to improve Nitro, but we have no updates to share on pricing in other countries at this time.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: I’m a desktop subscriber in one of these countries, how come I don’t have localized prices?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Go to the Subscriptions page - if you don’t see the localized price listed for your subscription, make sure you have a valid payment method and that the payment method is issued by a bank in one of the eligible countries. You should then receive a popup asking you to confirm your localized price.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: How can I see if I am receiving a localized price?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: The desktop subscriptions settings page will show you what price you are receiving for Nitro. If it doesn’t currently show the localized price, you may still be eligible. Follow the steps in the Q above. Note that certain not all Nitro tiers are eligible for localized pricing at this time.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: When does the new price take effect?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: At your next billing cycle. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Do Nitro Gifts have localized pricing?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Unfortunately, Nitro gifts will be charged in USD. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: I still can’t pay for Nitro because [X] (e.g. you don’t accept my payment method).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: We’re trying to improve support for buying Nitro in many different countries! Any feedback from users is helpful to us.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Why were there additional fees or taxes on my purchase in a localized pricing country?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: When making a purchase in a country where localized pricing is available, mandatory fees and/or taxes may be imposed. Please reach out to your bank or payment processor if you have questions about taxes or fees.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: My bank in Brazil won't process my payment in BRL. What should I do?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: We are aware of this issue and working on a fix with our payment providers. We apologize for any inconvenience! In the meantime, you can try switching to an alternative payment method, which may resolve the issue.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: I purchased a Nitro/Nitro Classic Monthly or Yearly subscription before localized pricing became available in my country. Can I get a refund?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: We are happy to issue a refund for your purchase if it falls within our</span> <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refund Policy</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

However, your subscription will automatically be updated to the new localized price upon the next renewal date. We appreciate your understanding!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Q: Why did the PLN pricing in Poland change after December 14, 2022?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A: To clarify, on December 14, 2022, we grandfathered our previous Polish prices as we expanded Euro pricing availability to our Polish users.</p>\n<p>If you subscribed to Nitro, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting before this date, <strong>you will keep your current pricing as long as you don't make any further subscription changes</strong>. Such changes include changing the frequency at which you are billed (yearly or monthly) or the tier of your subscription (for example, going from Nitro to Nitro Classic).</p>\n<p>If you’d like to cancel your subscription, you can do so by going to User Settings &gt; Subscriptions. However, keep in mind that canceling your subscription will also result in a loss of grandfathered prices once your subscription ends.</p>"

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General Thread Moderation Management</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, threads inherit permissions from the channel in which they were created. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If members are able to view a channel, then they are also able to view threads in that channel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they have </span><strong>Send Messages in Threads</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> permission enabled, then they can send messages in Threads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they have </span><strong>Create Public Threads </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span><strong>Create Private Threads</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> permission enabled, they can create a thread from an existing message or scratch.</span></p>\n<h2>CREATING THREADS</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to create a thread in the server, server members will need either the “Create Public Threads” or “Create Private Threads” permissions. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “Create Public Threads” permission will allow server members to create threads that can be publicly viewed by others who have access to the text channel. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “Create Private Threads” permission will allow server members to create private threads that can only be accessed by those who are mentioned in the thread!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>PARTICIPATING IN THREADS</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To send a message within a thread, server members will need the “Send Messages in Thread” permission, which allows server members to participate within threads only - not for all general channels in the server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the “Send Message” permission will only apply to messages outside of threads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By having separate permissions, this allows for some advanced setups, such as allowing server members to participate in threads created off of announcement posts, but not allowing those members to post in the announcement channel!</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBM6ZR554F3K8ZKHNW730AQA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moderating Threads</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help with moderating threads, we’ve added a new permission, “Manage Threads”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since threads are generally a new form of “content” in a server, we recommend giving this permission to your “content moderators”, which is likely the same people who have the “Manage Messages” permission in your server.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creator of a thread, as well as moderators who have the “Manage Threads” permission, will be able to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rename a thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Archive a thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove users from a private thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edit the auto-archive duration on a thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restrict who can invite members to a private thread</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moderators who have the “Manage Threads” permission will also be able to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unarchive a thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set slowmode on a thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">View all private threads in a channel</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove users from a public thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delete a thread</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBM700EDTAGV2B2B1BZVWE9V\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locking down a thread</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes discussion in a thread can get out of hand, and a moderator needs to step in. We’ve built two tools to help with this:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Slowmode</strong></a> can be set on a thread by going to the “Edit” screen, to limit how often folks can send a message in a thread</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moderator</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> archives a thread, they can choose to </span><strong>Lock</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a thread, which means only moderators can unarchive them. This provides a way to shut down all discussion in a thread.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, sometimes when creating a private thread and you <strong>don’t</strong> want to allow others to add people to it, you can uncheck the \"Anyone can invite\" option in the Thread dropdown menu!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4406694114967/image5.png\" alt=\"image5.png\" width=\"423\" height=\"780\"></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBSVGX50W2FWBRJFZ19RMFT1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow Mode</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord already allows slowmode to be set on a channel. When set, it allows users to only send one message and create one thread within your designated time interval. For example, if you set slowmode to 1 minute, users can only create one thread and send one message per minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, for even more granularity, slowmode can also be set for each individual thread. This won’t copy over from the parent channel and only moderators with the “Manage Threads” permission can adjust this setting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can set specific slow modes in each individual thread by right-clicking a thread (or by clicking on the three dot symbol at the top of your window), and then selecting <strong>Edit Thread. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then once you're in the Threads Settings menu, you can move the slowmode slider to your desired time interval!</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4405250629911/edit_thread_screenshot.png\" alt=\"edit_thread_screenshot.png\" width=\"613\" height=\"382\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4405198133655/thread.png\" alt=\"thread.png\"></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01FBJE3H1M0DM4KYZ027GDVJF8\">Tips for Moderating Threads</h1>\n<p>With Threads being a new feature, we wanted to share some tips and tricks to help get you started with moderating Threads and Thread permissions</p>\n<p><strong>1. Use the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055709773\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View Server as Role</a> feature within your Role Settings to test your Thread permissions! </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the View as Role feature, you can get a better understanding and see the perspective of what threads are viewable from another role. \n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Private Threads include <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong><em>users</em></strong></span> who have access (not <em>roles</em> who have access) so there may be some discrepancies!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">2. Grant the Manage Threads permissions to moderators and admins to help moderate and manage messages in your server!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Manage Threads permission allows members to rename, delete, archive/unarchive, turn on slowmode for a thread, and view private threads - this is a great tool to help empower your moderators to manage content in your server. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Create a testing channel for your moderators and server members to experiment with threads!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New features are exciting to test for the first time, but it may cause server chaos if Threads are spammed within an already established channel. Having a dedicated testing ground will help avoid both figurative and literal loose Threads. </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4405079321495/testing_threads_demo_screenshot.png\" alt=\"testing_threads_demo_screenshot.png\"></p>"

This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403135977495\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Sticker suggestions</span></a> that appear on desktop and mobile.</li>\n<li>When typing the related Unicode emoji into chat using :name:</li>\n<li>Searching for a sticker in your sticker drawer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img style=\"height: 252px; width: 518px;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14564163602455\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H090BF4YRV62BMTNG93GBJ76\"><strong>Optional: Entering a description (Alt-text)</strong></h2>\n<p>We strongly recommend adding a short, concise description (alt-text) for each custom sticker. This will allow people who use screen readers to know what your sticker looks like without needing to see the actual sticker.</p>\n<p>Good descriptions are short and descriptive of what a sticker looks like, plus describing the emotion the sticker is conveying.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img style=\"height: 333px; width: 337px;\" src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14564163694871\"></p>\n<p><strong>Good Example Description:</strong> A pink flower character smiles peacefully as it steps across the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor Example Description:</strong> Animated flower steps out of a blue circle with green sky and clouds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H090BQKTEHTWGMGRCWWRZMTH\"><strong>Tips for writing descriptions</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to use proper spelling, capitalization, spacing, and grammar. </li>\n<li>Describe the image as you see it, and choose to write about the most important features of the image. Ideas on what to describe:\n<ul>\n<li>Placement of objects within the image</li>\n<li>Subject (animal, human, etc)</li>\n<li>Emotions, like smiling or </li>\n<li>Colors</li>\n<li>Clothing detail</li>\n<li>Text (if there’s some in the image)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What not to write:\n<ul>\n<li>Obvious details (like “human has two eyes and a nose”)</li>\n<li>Focusing on details not central to what’s happening in the image </li>\n<li>Using creative writing techniques</li>\n<li>Do not use emojis</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H090BYTYV1KR4VC7FYPFSP7W\"><strong>Editing and Deleting Uploaded Custom Stickers</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Editing:</strong> Click on the pencil icon that appears when you hover your mouse over a sticker.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deleting:</strong> Click on the red ‘X’ icon that appears when you hover your mouse over a sticker to delete the sticker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Note: You cannot edit the sticker file once it has been uploaded. If you want to replace the sticker file, you’ll need to delete this sticker and upload a new file!</strong></h3>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H2RBGF6TNF547ZRF53YQ5VGT\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<br></strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Q: Who can use custom stickers that have been uploaded in my server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Anyone who has joined your server can use custom stickers within your server. Users who have a Nitro subscription will be able to use the custom stickers anywhere on Discord (other servers, direct messages, etc). </p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I prevent people from sending stickers in my server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There’s no permission to completely disable sending stickers in a server. If you want to prevent your server members from sending custom stickers from <em>other </em>servers, you’ll need to disable the “Use External Emoji and Stickers” permission for the @everyone role in your server.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What kind of content can I use for my stickers?</strong></p>\n<p>A: As is true for all content that you use on Discord, you are responsible for ensuring that any content you use for custom stickers complies with our<a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Terms of Service</a> and<a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Community Guidelines</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Once a sticker is deleted, can it be brought back?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No it cannot. There’s no way to undo this action, so once a custom sticker is deleted it’s gone for good!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I upload multiple stickers at a time?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You won't be able to upload multiple stickers at once right now. If you’d like to see this in the future though, head to our feedback site and vote up the idea:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/feedback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/feedback</a></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens to the previously uploaded custom stickers if the server loses a Boost level?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Don’t worry, your custom stickers are safe! If your server loses a Boost level, then you won’t be able to use the custom stickers in that level until the Boost level is reached again. You’ll also be able to see exactly which custom stickers can’t be used after losing a Boost level under Server Settings &gt; Stickers. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can we delete stickers that are locked behind a recently lost Boost level?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can still delete stickers in the locked level if you need to by following the same deletion steps listed above!</p>\n<p><strong>File Type Questions</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between APNG and a PNG file?</strong></p>\n<p>A: PNG files are a static, image file format that compresses images in a specific way to prevent quality loss. An APNG file is the animated version of this file format! </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can’t we use other file types for custom stickers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>We wanted to make sure your sticker creations looked just as beautiful in the app as when you’re creating them, so we chose file types that will help support that!</p>"

We know that it can be difficult to know how to refer to new people you meet (profile pics and nicknames only get you so far) and even more difficult to correct people if they identify you incorrectly.</p>\n<p>Having pronouns displayed makes it easier for communities to provide welcoming spaces for their users, because when people make assumptions about gender identity, it can be <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">harmful and painful</a>. Displaying pronouns is also an act of compassion and solidarity with those who need to express themselves and their identities in order to be seen and referred to correctly.</p>\n<p>The pronoun picker bot is an easy, off-the-shelf solution for server admins who want to enable users to self-select their pronouns if they are interested in doing so. Using our <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012250861-Bots-Buttons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">brand-new Buttons</a> for bots, assigning pronouns to your profile or nickname has never been easier.</p>\n<p>We hope this helps everyone feel a little more comfortable, a little more expressive, and a little more knowledgeable!

Then type the text you want to be displayed in your new Button and hit 'enter.'</li>\n<li>You can add up to 12 additional options (on top of the default set of 3, in blurple), for a total of 15 configurable Buttons.

We believe public Stages can be a great way to welcome new members in and grow your community, so we’re excited for you to try it out.</p>\n<p>Discord users can utilize the new Stage Discovery feature to join different Stage events, and if they like the event and the people behind it, they can also join the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01F68GCD7PJMYN6H2XEA1SKPTT\">Is this different from Server Discovery?</h2>\n<p>Yes, Server Discovery allows users to browse different public Servers. Stage Discovery allows users to browse public Stages. Any Community server can create a public Stage channel that is discoverable for users regardless of whether they are a public server.</p>\n<p>To learn more about <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Server Discovery check out this article</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Can I feature any other type of channel in Discovery?</strong></span></p>\n<p>As of right now, only Stage channels are eligible to be featured in Discovery.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What are Stage Channels and how do I set one up?</span></strong></p>\n<p>For information on how to set up a <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stage Channel please see our article here</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Will everyone be able to access Stage Discovery?</strong></span></p>\n<p>At launch Stage Discovery will only be available in the following countries: US, AU, CA, GB.

To help, we also wanted to make our overall look and feel just as welcoming to the world as the ever-improving in-app experience and help everyone enjoy Discord just a bit more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, welcome to Discord. Again. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Get Right Into It… *Why* Would We Change Our Logo?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our current logo has stuck around with us since the beginning of time itself… as in, since we first launched Discord in 2015. A lot of people aren’t aware that the little smiley icon in the Discord logo has a name: Clyde. Most people call him Discord, Mickey Mouse pants, a game controller, and of course, ugly. :(</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317842/Rebrand_Blog__1_.png\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__1_.png\"></p>\n<h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">\n<span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OG Clyde, hiding in his little bubble he calls home.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><br></span>\n</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, you’ll see old Clyde within a rounded rectangle chat bubble. Technically, being inside this bubble is Clyde’s “home.” Whether it’s on our website, within a profile icon on our social pages, or inside the app icon on your computer or mobile device, Clyde was always “in” something, like a hamster stuck in a rolling ball. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only the most eagle-eyed may notice, but the old logo was horizontally asymmetrical —  something our Design Team’s been waiting years to fix. Small details such as “Clyde lives within a bubble” and “not symmetrical” can be deceivingly restrictive when creating new interface elements, art assets, and even merch items.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317862/Rebrand_Blog__2_.jpg\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__2_.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, we took a step back and thought to ourselves: How can we give Clyde a refresh without going too crazy? And what makes Clyde, well… Clyde? It took a while for us to land in a good place — people around the world are already familiar with the Discord logo, so we can’t have them wake up one day seeing something weird like a banana as our icon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a preview of all the ideas and experimentation we went through when determining how Clyde should look. We went from lots of circular shapes to what’s basically a :) and eventually refining the more squared-off shape that you’re seeing today. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317902/Rebrand_Blog__3_.gif\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__3_.gif\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve also freed Clyde from being stuck in his bubble, and he’s very excited about it. In fact, you might even see Clyde smile. Or be a bit sad. Or sleepy. A good amount of fan art depicts Clyde with expressions, but now we’re officially letting Clyde feel what he needs to feel. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317882/Rebrand_Blog__4_.png\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__4_.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you take a peek at the top of Clyde’s head, you may notice the old antennas look a bit more like shoulders now. We realized that sharp little antennas didn't translate well when printed on different types of materials, or when printed on really small surfaces such as a pin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, we believe changes to Clyde present him in a more friendly tone, reshaped to be more understandable whether smaller or larger, all while still keeping our pal looking unique and familiar to the most veteran of users. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015632001/Rebrand_Blog__5_.gif\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__5_.gif\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these smaller details, improvements, and new options that add up to a fresh new look for years to come. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making Our Mark: The New Wordmark</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the refreshed Clyde, you’ll also see an updated the Discord wordmark, which is a fancy way of saying “the font used to spell out ‘Discord’” — it’s a custom font based upon “Ginto” that we created to go with the new Clyde logo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We explored hundreds of different fonts before landing on this very unique font face that we believe captures the playfulness of Discord. We even tweaked some elements of the font and letters so it’s easier to read than how it originally was.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631901/Rebrand_Blog__6_.png\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__6_.png\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest thing that we debated, changed, changed back, changed back again, agonized over and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have even had serious anxiety about was whether we should keep the wordmark in all caps or in title case. Once something is finalized and the world sees, there’s no going back, and that includes how things are capitalized.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, we decided that Title case — making sure it’s always capitalized like someone’s name — made our new wordmark more legible. Although you won't often see the wordmark used on its own, it does look beautiful.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shades of Deep Blurple (And Other Colors)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good ol’ Blurple: Just like Clyde, Blurple is in every corner of Discord. It’s not exactly blue, not exactly purple... but it’s definitely close to our hearts. All of our older colors were a bit on the pastel-y side, along with our cleverly-named shades of Grey including… “Greyple,” “Dark, but not black” and “Not quite black.” </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a new logo comes a brighter, more saturated Blurple: <strong>below is our new Blurple, right alongside the new Clyde and our new wordmark so you can cohesively see the new look</strong>:</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631881/Brand_Refresh_Blog_Header_1.gif\" alt=\"Brand_Refresh_Blog_Header_1.gif\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internally, we first used this new color “blurple_5_plus_adjustments,” but that didn’t quite roll off the tongue as well as Blurple did. The lighter color of Blurple will forever be known as “OG Blurple.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We wanted to bring more energy to Discord for our entire color palette by brightening up the colors to be more bold and playful. Along with refining many of the existing colors with a brighter hue, we’re bringing a bit more variety to the color palette by introducing a new color: Red.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631921/Rebrand_Blog__8_.gif\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__8_.gif\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might recognize some of these colors — they’re inspired by application features that you’re likely familiar with on Discord, such as Online, Away, and Do Not Disturb status messages. And while pink isn’t a direct correlation to an in-app color, it’s as equally playful and fun as the rest of ‘em. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a bit more lively. A little bit brighter. And hopefully, a bit more like home. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317922/Rebrand_Blog__9_.png\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__9_.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see the entire set of new colors over at <a href=\"https://discord.com/branding\" target=\"_self\">discord.com/branding</a>.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How This Affects Using Discord </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we say our new palette is inspired by using Discord on the day-to-day, that doesn’t mean these colors are strictly for our website or blog. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you open up Discord next time, things might feel a bit brighter. We’ve got our logos and colors, along with some new typography and art on the login and registration pages.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you're logged in, the changes will be more subtle. New Clyde will be welcoming you on the top-left, just as he always has, and all the colors will be just a bit bolder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631961/Rebrand_Blog__10_.png\" alt=\"Rebrand_Blog__10_.png\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New typography will appear within certain headings throughout the app, but the majority of the headings and fonts will stay the same as they are today. As the year goes on, you may notice additional updates here and there, such as changes to illustrations in empty states and tooltips — we want to make sure they’re perfect first.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Did The Community Help Out with These Changes?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discord has become a place for millions around the world to </span><a href=\"https://blog.discord.com/discord-is-where-creativity-shines-f64a659aa5b6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create art</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to karaoke nights and </span><a href=\"https://blog.discord.com/celebrating-earth-day-across-the-planet-ca170d0037ec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sharing plant care tips</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, speculate about cryptocurrencies, and on occasion, accidentally fall asleep because you’ve been up too late on voice. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When figuring out our new styles, we connected with over 26,000 members of the community to ask what Discord means to them.
