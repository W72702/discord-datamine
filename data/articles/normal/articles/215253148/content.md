<p>Even if you <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209791877" target="_self">mute a channel</a> or an entire server, @everyone mentions will still bring up notifications. If a server is being particularly spammy with these all-powerful attention-catchers, you can suppress them to regain a little bit of sanity and peace of mind. Step-by-step:</p>
<p>1. Click the server name to bring down the server pull-down menu:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>2. Click "Notification Settings", and check out the super spiffy channel notification settings list. When you're done with that, click the "Suppress @everyone and @here" option:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>That simple. Remember, the "Suppress @everyone and @here" option functions on a <strong>per-server</strong> basis, so you can be selective about who you want to hear from depending on which server you're on. </p>
