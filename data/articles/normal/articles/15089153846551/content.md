<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-8c05a3fa-7fff-9959-21c9-99121fd7042c"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q: I don't see the promotion details on my Nitro tab. Why?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you don't see any promotion details on your Nitro tab on the desktop or browser (this promotion is not available on the mobile clients), it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I subscribe to Nitro Yearly during this promotion, what will I receive?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you subscribe to Nitro Yearly during this promotion, you will receive 1 month of Nitro for free at the end of your yearly subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I upgrade my subscription from Nitro Basic or Nitro Classic to Nitro, can I receive this promotion?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, this promotion applies for upgrades from Nitro Basic or Classic to Nitro.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How much will I be charged if I upgrade my plan to Nitro?</strong></p>
<p>A: The amount you'll be charged for upgrading to Nitro depends on:<br>1. Whether you're upgrading from Basic or Classic<br>2. The amount of your existing subscription plan you haven’t used<br>3. The remaining amount of your new subscription plan you will use after upgrading</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve only used ⅓ of your existing Nitro Basic monthly plan this month and decide to upgrade to Nitro for the remainder of this month, we would first refund you the remaining ⅔ of your Basic plan that you haven’t used. After, you would then pay the remaining amount of time this month - in this case, ⅔ of this month - on your new Nitro plan.</p>
<p>This way, you only pay for what you use when upgrading. If you’ve only used 10 days of Nitro Basic this month, you should only have to pay Basic’s price for those 10 days you used. And if you only have 20 days left this month after upgrading to your new Nitro plan, you should only have to pay Nitro’s price for those 20 days, not the entire month.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I claimed and redeemed a different free trial for Discord Nitro already. Can I access this promo?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, if you are currently on a free trial, you are not eligible for this promotion. Have no fear, there will be more of these down the road! </p>
<p><strong>Q: If I have Nitro credit in my account, can I apply it to this promo?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you have credit in your account from a previous Nitro subscription, this credit will be automatically applied to the purchase total when you check out.</p>
<p>If you have credit in your account that is associated with a different Nitro subscription type (ex: Nitro Classic), it will not apply to this promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a notification saying "You're ineligible for this offer". Why?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you encounter this notification, it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria outlined above.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I purchased a Nitro subscription during the promotion period, but I’d like to request a refund. What are the steps?</strong></p>
<p>A: Before requesting a refund, please review our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refund Policy</a> to ensure that your purchase is eligible for a refund.</p>

<p>Please note that if your refund is issued, you will lose any promotional value or discounts associated with the purchase.</p>
