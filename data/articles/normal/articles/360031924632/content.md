<h1>Mobile Voice Overlay</h1>
<p>Samsung Galaxy users now get to use our brand new <strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">DISCORD MOBILE VOICE OVERLAY </span><em>(CHAT HEADS, BUBBLES, HOWEVER YOU CALL EM)</em></strong>. Once enabled, whenever you're in an active voice call or channel on Discord, an overlay bubble will show up on your phone.</p>
<p>Tapping that bubble will expand to show what you see below!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360036962311/10.png" alt="10.png">Well, almost exactly what you see here if you have the same name and you have the same friends with the same avatars and you're playing the same game.</p>
<p><br>You will be able to see who's talking, who's in the call, and access shortcuts (speaker, mute, hang up) while using other apps—no need to switch back to Discord as this overlay will persist on your phone.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><em>Don't want to see the bubble?</em> </span>You can drag it out at any time! Just touch the bubble and you should see an "<span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>X</strong></span>" at the bottom of your screen, then simply move the bubble to the "<span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>X</strong></span>" and it'll go away.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360036962331/11.jpg" alt="11.jpg"></p>
<h3>
    <span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Moving the bubble onto the "<span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>X</strong></span>" <span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><strong>DOES NOT</strong></em></span> hang up the call. You will need to hang up explicitly by tapping on the hangup button within the expanded overlay or within Discord.
</h3>
<h1>How to enable mobile voice overlay</h1>
<p>Make sure you are on Discord Android Version 9.4.5. You can enable the <strong>Mobile Voice Overlay</strong> by going into <em>Settings</em> -&gt; <em>Voice &amp; Video</em> -&gt; and you should see a "<em>Enable Mobile Voice Overlay</em>" toggle.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360036962391/12.png" alt="12.png"></p>
<p>When you enable the toggle, you'll be taken to the Android System permissions to allow Discord to "draw on top". This permission is required to allow you to see the overlay while using other apps!</p>
