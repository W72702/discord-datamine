<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What are Premium Memberships Trials?</strong></span><br>If a server owner enables them, trials allow you to get access to premium membership benefits for free during the trial window. This lets you get a sense of what the experience is like so you can decide if you’d like to continue subscribing!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Why doesn’t my server have Trials?</strong></span><br>There could be a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Premium Memberships as a product is still being tested with a relatively small group of communities so it’s possible your server doesn’t have access to Premium Memberships yet.</li>
    <li>Trials are also being tested currently with a small subset of communities who have Premium Memberships so it’s possible your community still doesn’t have access to this feature</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also possible that your server owner hasn’t enabled trials yet and you can always check back to see if it’s an offer in the future!</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Why can I not sign up for a Trial? Others are able to.</strong></span></p>
<p>Trials may not be available to everyone. You may need to be in the guild for longer. If you’ve already redeemed a Trial previously, you may not qualify for another Trial.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Why are there no Trials on certain tiers?</strong></span></p>
<p>Server owners decide which tiers to enable Trials for.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Can I select how long I want a Trial to last?</strong></span></p>
<p>No, server owners decide how long Trial periods are on any tier they choose to enable Trials for.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Trial seats are all taken on a tier, what can I do now?</strong></span></p>
<p>Server owners set how many concurrent members can be in a Trial simultaneously. If you are eligible, you can enroll in the Trial once there is a vacant seat. Alternatively, if you want to receive the benefits of the Premium Membership tier right away, you can purchase membership without the Trial.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Will I be charged after a Trial ends?</strong></span></p>
<p>You can cancel before a Trial ends. At the end of a Trial, if you have not cancelled, you will begin paying for recurring monthly subscriptions, charged to your default payment method on file. You can cancel paid subscriptions at any point to stop auto-renewals the following month.</p>
