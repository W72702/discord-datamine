<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500007546062/1_NtFr9IAUxLPuiKKlRTK1zQ.png" alt="1_NtFr9IAUxLPuiKKlRTK1zQ.png" width="694" height="278"></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Stage channels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a special type of voice channel you can create in your Community server. They are for conversations and events where some people can talk and others can listen as the audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re running an event where you want only a select number of participants to be speaking or on video at a time with a majority of the audience in passive, listening mode - then Stage channels offer a great way to support and run that event!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In testing, we’ve seen people use Stage channels to run AMAs, Fireside Chats, Townhalls, Reading Groups, and more!</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GS8FEFA0X79N7SM76VGPD25D"><strong>How do they work?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within each Stage channel, a member can be a Stage moderator, a speaker, or just listen from the audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers are displayed at the top and the audience members are listed below, so it’s easy to see who is able to talk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage channels are a great way to broadcast to the whole server, because they can be pinned to the top of the channel list when they are “opened.” All you need to do to open a Stage is write a topic, and it will show up at the top below your server title or banner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, there are no enter or leave sounds in Stage channels. We want to make it super seamless and easy to hop in and out of Stage channels and not feel like you’re bothering people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’re encouraged to sit back, relax, and enjoy the conversation. Leave whenever you feel like it!</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12414283808023" alt="EN-stage-channel-banner.png"></span></p>
<h2 id="h_01F22AKYY4AFEK1JDWG2THSVY7"><strong>Who can speak in a Stage channel?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's talk a bit more about how speakers, Stage moderators, and audience members can interact and speak within the Stage channel!: </span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <strong>Speakers </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">are people who can talk in the channel. Speakers can easily move themselves back to the audience by clicking on the “Move to Audience” button. </span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <strong>Stage moderators</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are special speakers who can set a topic on the Stage channel and open it.</span>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have the power to add, mute, and remove other speakers. In short, they’re in charge of keeping the conversation flowing.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add entire roles or individual members to have Stage Moderator permissions.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">All server members (with permission to view the channel) will join Stage channels as the </span><strong>audience</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and will be muted.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage Moderators can become speakers on their own, but non-moderators and all other audience members must be invited up to speak or if they choose to, they can raise their hand and request to speak, which has to be approved by a Stage Moderator.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Start A Stage?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start a conversation on a Stage channel, you should first have the crucial permissions to manage the Stage channel as a Stage Moderator or Server Admin. These permissions include:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage Channel</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage Permissions</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move Members</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mention @ everyone when a Stage starts</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage Events</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have those permissions, simply select the desired Stage channel in your server channel list and choose the option that best fits how you want to manage the Stage for the conversation.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1">
        <strong>Start the Stage </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">will open up the Stage channel for server members to either join the audience. You will need to input a topic for discussion!</span>
    </li>
    <li aria-level="1">
        <strong>Create Event </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">will take you through the steps to set up and schedule an event that can take place in the Stage channel.</span>
    </li>
    <li aria-level="1">
        <strong>Continue without starting </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">will allow you to open the Stage channel without inputting a topic for conversation and notifying the server the Stage has started. This option allows you to set up the Stage, for server members to join the audience and wait, and for Stage Moderators to check the audio devices of speakers for the event. </span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12414343351703" alt="EN-waiting-stage-to-start-options.png"></span></p>
<h3>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Music will play for each server member waiting for the Stage to formally start and while Stage Moderators/Admins set up the Stage for the conversation. The music is available on a user level and not managed by server admins. To mute the music, press on the </span><strong>music note button</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage Moderators can become speakers on their own, but non-moderators and all other audience members must be invited up to speak or if they choose to, they can raise their hand and request to speak, which has to be approved by a Stage Moderator.</span></p>

</h3>
<p>In order to create a Stage Channel, you will need to have the “<strong>Manage Channels</strong>” and “<strong>Manage Roles</strong>” enabled for you in the server.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your server is already a Community server and you have the needed permissions, follow these steps below: </span></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Start by creating a new channel.</strong> </span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can do this by pressing the “+” button in the sidebar channel list or by heading into the Server Settings menu and selecting "Create Channel".</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Select the “Stage Channel” option as the Channel Type</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that currently only users with Manage Channels and Manage Roles can create new Stage channels!</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Once you hit "Next", you will be prompted to add roles or members who you want to grant Stage moderator permission to. </strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h_01GS8E8E90VZRG935WC9V8YRTD"><strong>How do I Enable Video or Screen Share?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are a speaker on a Stage channel, you can enable your camera to turn on your video by pressing the video camera button and </span><strong>Turn On Camera</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to Go Live with a window or screen as a speaker on a Stage channel, you can press the screen share button to </span><strong>Share Your Screen</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12414343100951" alt="EN-Stage-Channel-go-live-button.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers in Stage channels must have a server role with </span><strong>Video </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">permission or be given the </span><strong>Video </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">permission exclusively in the Stage channel to enable their video or Go Live.</span></p>

<h3>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, when you, stage moderators, admins, and speakers are using </span><strong>Video </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or screen sharing content with </span><strong>Go Live</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make sure to follow Discord’s </span><a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</h3>
<h2><strong>Stage Channel Capabilities and Limits</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some differences in capabilities and audience size limits depending on whether your Stage channel is </span><strong>Audio Only </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or is utilizing </span><strong>Video/Screen Share</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Audio Only Stage Channels</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>What Happens When the Stage Channel Hits its Video/Go Live audience limits?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If video/Go Live has already started in the Stage channel and the audience viewing size has reached its maximum limit, no more users can join.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">If video/Go Live has not started and the stage has more than 50 audience members (and is not Boosted to allow for a greater audience viewing size) then the Speakers and Stage moderators </span><strong>will not be able to start their video or screen share</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: For this reason we suggest you start your stage with at least one video on if you plan on doing video/screen share and anticipate you may hit your audience viewing size limit</span></h3>
<h2 id="h_01F22D3YHY5BBCWABT7PARJY7B"><strong>How do I add/remove Stage moderators? </strong></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> In order to modify the Stage moderators, you will need to have the “<strong>Manage Channels</strong>” and “<strong>Manage Roles</strong>” enabled in the server. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve built a special UI to make it easy for you to add/remove Stage moderators, but the underlying permissions are built on top of the permission system. This is why you might already see roles selected in the UI since those roles already have the set of permissions at the server-level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage moderators must have these permissions on the Stage channel itself:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Manage Channels</li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mute Members</li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move Members</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add or remove additional Stage moderators after you’ve created the Stage channel by going into your Channel settings! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the desktop app, once you press the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "Edit Channel" button, you can then select "Channel Permissions" in the left side bar, and you'll then be able to add and remove your current Stage moderators.</span></p>

<h2 id="h_01F22AMKZ3EY6EPFFBSA1SV0A5"><strong>How do I modify the “topic”?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the time comes, simply open the Stage channel and click “Open the Stage” at the bottom of the screen! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there you will be able to set your topic and open the Stage!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic will be displayed at the top of the Stage channel while active, and it will also be displayed at the top of your channel list while the event is active. </span></p>

<p>Now that your Stage channel is created, we'll walk through all of the abilities of a Stage moderator and how to use these moderation tools!</p>
<h2 id="h_01F22AMT97VZQGR6AWBM8J7JSW"><strong>What can I do as a Stage moderator?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Stage Moderator, you will have the ability to:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move yourself from Speaker to audience and vice versa.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disconnect members (from Stage Channel)</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move members from Speakers to audience</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move members from audience to Speakers. </span></li>

    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable or disable requests to speak.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01F22AN1BD3APW4A3GXP51NDM9"><strong>How do I remove members from the channel?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>For Desktop/Browser:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Stage moderator, you can right-click a specific audience member and then a menu will appear where you can press the “Disconnect from Stage” button to remove (kick) that member from the Stage channel. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>For Mobile:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can tap on a user’s profile to bring up their profile card to view this same menu and press the “Disconnect from Stage” button. </span></p>
<h2 id="h_01F22AN7AG26H5VF1KDXT6VGY7"><strong>How do I move a Speaker to the audience?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>For Desktop/Browser:</strong></span></p>

<p>For those of you who are just tuning in for the show, these guides below will help you learn how to join, interact with, and exit the Stage channel! </p>
<h2 id="h_01F22AP1EMFQ3AJKGYJPJTR5RS"><strong>How do I join a Stage channel in a server?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage channels behave just like normal channels. So just tap or click it and you’re in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing here is that by default, you will join as an audience member with your mic muted. You can request to speak if you want, but otherwise, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're a Stage moderator, you'll have the option to join as a speaker or as an audience member! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also made it silent to join and exit Stage channels, so you’ll never have to feel like you’re bothering others. Come and go without interrupting anyone! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Stage moderator grants you access to speak you will see an invite bar at the top of your screen where you can accept or decline the invitation to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Stage moderator can also invite you to speak without you raising your hand—however, you will always have to accept the invite before you can become a Speaker. </span></p>
