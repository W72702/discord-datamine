<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Premium App Subscriptions</strong> are a monthly subscription to premium features of an app that any member in a server can purchase to get enhanced functionality and more commands for the app in that server. At the discretion of the developer of the app, subscriptions can be divided up into tiers and each tier may have unique pricing and features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers of the apps provide the premium subscriptions and features. They are responsible for creating the tiers and their descriptions, and they also provide the subscriptions themselves and any associated content or other features. Please read the tier descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because these are a recurring subscription, we’ll charge you monthly until you cancel the subscription (which you can do any time as further described below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unhappy with your Premium App Subscription, try contacting the developer of the app directly. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, you can request a refund <a href="#h_01GFK3DZ3PGJ0DKGE61VEK5J51" target="_self">as described below</a>. If you experience technical issues with Discord that prevent you from accessing your Premium App Subscription, reach out to us at <a href="https://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis.gd/billing</a> and choose “<strong>Premium Apps</strong>” under Type of billing issue. If you experience technical issues with an app, please contact the developer of the app.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to request a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refund</a> for a Premium App Subscription purchase you’ve made, you must <a href="dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out to our Support Team</a> within 5 days of your initial purchase of the subscription. </span></p>
<h3>
    <strong>Important Note: </strong><strong><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a one-time refund, meaning if you’ve previously purchased a Premium App Subscription for an app in any server and received a refund for it, then you will not be eligible for a refund to a Premium App Subscription for that app again. </span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, if an app you’ve purchased a Premium App Subscription for is removed from the applicable server by us or the developer or if you are banned from the applicable server or generally from Discord, you may also request a pro-rated refund for the remainder of the subscription within 5 days of such event. You can contact our team at the following link: <a href="https://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis.gd/billing</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to pick “Premium Apps” from the Type of billing issue dropdown menu to navigate to the refund request form. We will review requests and determine your eligibility for a refund on a case-by-case basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any refund requests or issues not covered by the above, please contact the developer of the applicable app.</span></p>
