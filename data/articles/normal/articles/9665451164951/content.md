<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord allows you to choose the default quality of your video uploads on the Discord mobile app and will automatically compress the videos you upload according to your settings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find the Video Upload Quality settings in the ‘Text &amp; Media’ section of your user settings in the app. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From <strong>Text &amp; Media</strong>, you'll be able to choose between three types of video uploads: <strong>Best Quality, Standard (Recommended), </strong>and <strong>Data Saver.</strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note</strong>: These compression settings only apply to video uploads, <strong>not images.</strong></span></h3>
<h2>Best Quality</h2>
<p>When you select ‘<strong>Best Quality</strong>’, uploaded videos will be compressed to the highest resolution available, up to 720p (1080p for Nitro users).</p>
<h2>Standard (Default)</h2>
<p>When you select ‘<strong>Standard</strong>’, uploaded videos will be compressed to 480p (up to 720p for Nitro users). This is the default setting for video uploads. It is also the setting that Discord recommends for balancing performance and data usage.</p>
<h2 id="h_01GFSA6X26Q4GB0QNMYJKAVB1K">Data Saving Mode</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This setting overrides the Video Upload Quality setting.
</h3>
<p>When the ‘<strong>Data Saving Mode</strong>’ setting is turned on, images and videos will be sent in lower quality when your device is using a cellular network. This reduces data usage. If this setting is enabled and you are connected to Wi-Fi, videos will upload in your selected Video Upload Quality. When you are using a cellular network, videos will upload in ‘<strong>Data Saver</strong>’ Quality and images will upload in 360p. You can find the Data Saving Mode setting in the ‘<strong>Data</strong>’ section of your app settings.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This setting overrides the Video Upload Quality setting. For example, if your Video Upload Quality is set to ‘<strong>Best Quality</strong>’ (and you are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a nitro subscriber), your videos will upload in ‘<strong>Best Quality</strong>’ (720p) when connected to Wi-Fi, and in ‘<strong>Data Saver</strong>’ (360p) when using a cellular network. </span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GFSA77SNVJYZNX6ZXV2G8C9K">FAQ</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q. Where can I change my upload quality settings?</strong></span><br>A. In the Discord mobile app, tap your profile in the bottom right corner of the app to open <strong>User Settings &gt; App Settings &gt; Text &amp; Media &gt; Video Uploads.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q. What is the longest video or maximum file size I can upload for each setting?</strong></span><br>A. Because each video compresses differently, the maximum video length or original file size you can upload at each setting will vary.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q. Can I upload videos in their original resolution?</strong></span><br>A. With Discord’s video compression, the maximum resolution for video uploads sits at the ‘Best Quality’ setting, which compresses videos to 1080p for those with a Nitro subscription and 720p for non-Nitro members.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q. Where can I find Data Saving Mode?</strong></span><br>A. In the Discord mobile app, tap your profile in the bottom right corner of the app to open your <strong>User Settings &gt; App Settings &gt; Text &amp; Media &gt; Data Consumption. </strong></p>
