<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more people come to Discord every year to experience awesome communities like yours. But sometimes the experience of joining a new community can feel like being cannon-blasted into a strange, foreign land that gets new people asking “Sooo… what am I supposed to do here?” or “Why are there so many channels?!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, many new people on Discord trying to join your community don’t understand what “bots” are, what roles do, or which of your many channels to check out. And when they get confused and overwhelmed, they just leave. Surely there </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be an easier way to get people to join your community, know their way around, and actually stay and become a part of your tribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where </span><strong>Community Onboarding </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes in to help you save the day.</span></p>

<h1 id="h_01GMNXFHMY8CMY1D7C29SY62KQ"><strong>Here’s how it works</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help anyone join your communities on Discord with ease and delight, we’re giving community admins the ability to create a personalized onboarding experience. With </span><strong>Community Onboarding,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new members get to pick out their own roles and channels and enjoy a personalized channel list in your server by answering a few simple questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they’re in, they can adjust their answers to your questions to swap roles or channels at any time in a new Channels &amp; Roles tab above their channel list.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074815255831" alt="example-GIF-community-onboarding.gif"></span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GMNXFXAA29XSV1RTYXAXE45S"><strong>Great! How do I set up Community Onboarding?</strong></h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Add Default Channels</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, head over to <strong>Server Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Onboarding</strong> and start the setup process by adding Default Channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Default Channels will be the channels that all new members will see in their channel list when joining your Community. These should typically be your most popular and valuable channels you think every new member should have on their channel list.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074770749719" alt="add-default-channels-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></p>
<p><strong>Best practices: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize channels with healthy activity and friendly for new joiners, like #general, #polls, #giveaways, forums, or LFG channels.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid including channels that aren’t useful or relevant for most new members as part of your Default Channels - you’ll be able to assign those later!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>2. Create Customization Questions</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members will answer Customization Questions to pick additional channels and roles. Create a question, give it some answers, and then assign relevant channels and/or roles for each answer choice. When a member picks that answer, they will be granted those roles and those channels will be added to their channel list!</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074770205847" alt="create-custom-questions-community-faq.png"></p>
<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Customization questions let you create questions and answers that let new members pick out their own roles and channels.</h4>
<p><strong>Start by asking questions that assign new members additional channels</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try using a question like “What would you like to do here?” to assign your main channels</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074782975511" alt="additional-questions-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></h4>
<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each question, add answer options that assign channels and/or roles when selected</span></h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074783095831" alt="additional-questions-2-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></p>
<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What new members will see</span></h4>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also ask a question like “What off-topic channels do you want?” to assign off-topic channels</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074783141015" alt="off-topic-questions-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each question, you can choose to:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <strong>Ask before a member joins</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - this shows your questions and answers to new members right before they join your server. Questions that assign channels and important roles should be asked before a member joins.</span>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions without this toggled on will be included in the Channels &amp; Roles tab above everyone’s channel list, for members to check out later. Use this for questions around non-urgent customizations, like vanity roles.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <strong>Allow multiple answers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - lets new members select multiple answer choices for the same question. Great for those “Choose all that apply” questions.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make Required</strong> - members must answer the question to proceed into your server. If a question assigns important channels, consider making it required!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the “</span><strong>Preview</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">” button at the top to test out the look and feel of your questions and answer options, and ensure they assign the correct channels and/or roles as intended.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid including too many answer options or members will feel overwhelmed.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t make answer options or descriptions too long! Keep them short and sweet where possible so new members can read and answer them easily.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10394859532823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Onboarding examples</a> article for specific examples of good, simple questions to ask new members.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>3. Make sure most of your member channels are assignable through Onboarding</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of your member channels should be included in either Default Channels or Questions, so that members can select them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If channels are left out of onboarding, newer members may not ever find those channels! If there are lots of channels left out, try creating additional questions or answers that assign them.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074783207319" alt="member-channels-assignable-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></p>
<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure most of your member channels are assignable through Onboarding! We'll let you know which channels haven't been assigned.</span></h4>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>4. Review and publish</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve selected your Default Channels and set up your Customization Questions, you’ll be able to enable and preview your Onboarding setup from the point of view of a new member joining your server, assuming you meet the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have selected at least 7 Default Channels</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 5 of these channels must allow @everyone to View and Send Messages</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074783278615" alt="enable-channels-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>5. Remove verification steps that overwhelm or lock new members from joining your server</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember how confusing it can be for newer folks who get easily confused and overwhelmed by bot-powered verification steps that block access to certain parts of your server? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Community Onboarding, you have an easy way to grant new members their own </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">roles and channels from the start and show them all the cool things your community has to offer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, consider removing bot-powered restrictions that add confusion and turn away new members trying to join your server.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But Discord, wouldn’t that make my server more vulnerable to raiders also trying to join my server?!”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that, we have the solution: Raid Protection</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11074783366551" alt="raid-protection-feature-community-onboarding-faq.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy greater peace of mind from join-raids without the downside of restricting well-intentioned folks from your server. Our Raid Protection system uses machine learning to automatically detect suspicious behavior or activity happening in your server that are indicative of a likely join-raid about to take place. </span></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a possible join-raid is detected, our system will take automated actions to protect your server before it happens, such as sending you an alert so you can investigate and take action, and requiring CAPTCHA for new joiners within the next hour to help keep out botted accounts trying to join your server in large numbers. This way, you can feel comfortable using Community Onboarding without worrying about complicated bot restrictions or raiders trying to join your server en masse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can enable alerts to receive notifications when suspicious server-join activity or behavior is detected in <strong>Server Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Safety Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Raid Protection</strong>.

<p><strong>Q: What happens to channels that I don’t assign to any Customization Questions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Channels you don’t assign to Customization Questions will still exist in your server but won’t be assignable for new members going through your Community Onboarding experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members will be able to find, access, and add these channels to their channel list by going to Channels &amp; Roles &gt; Browse Channels.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the point of unmarking “Ask before member joins” for a Customization Question?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you create a Customization Question and choose to unmark “Ask before member joins,” it will appear in Channels &amp; Roles &gt; Customize but will no longer appear to new members who go through your onboarding experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose to do this if you want to ask members that are already in your server questions that easily assign them roles and channels.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will members who leave my server and rejoin have to go through my onboarding process again?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes.</span></p>
