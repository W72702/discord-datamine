<p>We've taken steps to further enhance using a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021977652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord Certified Device</a> by working directly with hardware creators to bring you the most buttery smooth experience starting when you plug in your peripheral.</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>The first time you enter a voice chat after connecting your device you'll be asked, via pop-up, if you would like to update your settings.</p>

<p>By selecting 'Switch' your <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> Settings will automatically be adjusted to the optimal set-up for the device you're using.</p>

<p>To confirm this check <strong>User Settings &gt; Voice &amp; Video &gt; Input shows Certified ✓</strong></p>
<h3>Note: If you click 'Not right now' you can still select that device in <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> Settings, and you'll get its optimized configuration.</h3>
<h1>Advanced Settings</h1>
<p>To reduce any issues between Discord's settings and the device you are using - your Advanced Settings will also update. </p>

<p><em>'While using a Discord Certified microphone certain voice processing features are no longer handled by Discord itself, but rather the microphone.'</em> - The example above shows both <strong>Echo Cancellation</strong> and <strong>Noise Suppression</strong> grayed out. This means that the settings have updated for optimal performance for the device being used.</p>
