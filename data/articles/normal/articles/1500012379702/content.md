<p>On <strong>May, 23, 2021</strong>, Discord became aware of two distinct issues occurring on the Android mobile client:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Issue 1: Notification Banner Replies</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Replies via notification banners not sending and/or disappearing.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Issue 2: Broken Image Downloads</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Photo downloads being attempted would fail with the error </em><em>"Download failed"</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Both incidents have been flagged with our team and we will be pushing out a new update to address these issues soon. We sadly don't have an ETA at this time for when this will be released, but we will be updating this page as soon as we hear back from our team.</p>
<p>We apologize for any confusion and inconvenience this may have caused in the meantime. </p>
