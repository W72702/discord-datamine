<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Discord communities grow, it is important that the server is supported properly by moderation teams and are providing safe environments for their community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to support this goal, we have server member caps to help ensure that Discord users have a great experience, and that server owners and their moderator teams are receiving the support they need to foster healthy communities. </span></p>
<p>If your server is approaching its member size limit, you’ll need to send in a request to our team to grow past 250k members! At that point, we will review your server and decide whether your server qualifies for a server member cap increase.</p>
<h3>In order to submit a Server Member Cap Increases, you must be the Server Owner.</h3>
