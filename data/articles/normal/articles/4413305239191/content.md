<p>Is someone being a menace in your server? Introducing server Time Out! </p>
<p>This feature enables server moderators and admins to temporarily prevent a user from interacting in a server.</p>
<h1>What does that mean?</h1>
<p>This means the affected user won't be able to send messages, react to messages, join voice channels or video calls while in "timeout". <br><br>In order to access this feature, you will need to enable a new permission "<strong>Timeout Members</strong>"</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<div>1. Moderators and Admins can right-click on the offending user’s name bringing up the Profile Context Menu, from there the moderator can select to put the user in time out:</div>

<div>2. Moderators and Admins then choose a time limit for the time out and provides a reason for the time out. This reason is recorded in the audit log</div>

<div>3. Moderators and Admins with the ability to timeout users will see an icon after the time stamp. All other server members will see the message unchanged and the timed out users messages will appear “normal”</div>
