<h1><strong><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">FRIENDS UNTIL THE VERY END</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Discord's friends list feature brings the old, familiar side of online friends to Discord. While we're thrilled at how Discord lets you join servers filled with new people that share your passions &amp; interests! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">We're excited to bring your partners-in-crime even closer than before. Let's dive right into how the friends list helps out:</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img style="height: 169px; width: 622px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15080536735639"></span><em><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">         </span></em></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><em><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">   oooh, shiny.</span></em><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">We understand that you may never have had the real-life urge to write down all of your friends on a piece of paper, but Discord's friends list has some killer built-in features too. Instead of needing to share a server with someone to send them a DM or check their status, the friends list gives you direct access to it. Here's a more detailed look:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">A lot going on there. Let's break it down piece by piece. Open up your friends list by clicking the icon above your server list. It'll happily highlight in blurple when you find it. </span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">THE FRIENDS LIST MENU</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">This is where you'll sort the main friends list window. Each selection will adjust which friends you see in the window, as such:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">All:  All of your friends in one big window.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Online:  All of your friends who are online, not offline. You'll still see idle users.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Pending:  Anyone who's sent you a friend request. Don't leave them hanging!</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Blocked:  All users who you've blocked. </span></li>
</ul>

    <strong><span style="color: #104c32;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Pro Tip: You can totally </span></strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488"><strong><span style="color: #0067e0;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">block users from sending you unwanted DMs</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #104c32;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">. You guys asked, we delivered. Boom.</span></strong>
</h3>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">BE MY FRIEND, PAL</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">The process for adding a friend is pretty simple. Clicking the "Add Friend" button at the top will bring up this screen:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">1. Username    </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Following that format, the end result should look like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Wumpus</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">(Yes, usernames are case-sensitive!)</span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">TUTORIAL BREAK:</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">To grab it, click their avatar in the user list, or in the chat window:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Alternatively, if you don't like using that button, or you're super excited you found someone SO IMPORTANT that they need adding without leaving the screen, you can right-click their username/avatar, and you'll see a green "send friend request" button once you click "profile". Seriously, you can't miss it:</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #104c32;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Pro Tip: If you travel just a bit further down the right-click menu, you'll see the option to add your buddy directly in the menu. One-click and you're good to go!</span></strong></h3>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">THE FRIENDS LIST WINDOW</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">This is the list of all of your friends, filtered by what you've selected in the menu up top. In the three columns, you can see their name, status &amp; game playing, and what mutual servers you share.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If you can't see your mutual servers, expand your window. They're there, they just like to hide if the window is too small.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #104c32;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Pro tip: Click on the horizontal bar next to any users name to be whisked to your DM screen with them. You can also click a server icon to be taken on a magical journey to that server's #general channel!</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">That about wraps up what we've got for the friends list so far. But just you wait, the party's just getting started.</span></p>
