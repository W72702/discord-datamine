<p>Ah, the Terms of Service: everyone’s favorite thing to read. Below you’ll find a summary of the key updates, but please do read the full <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, as they are what actually govern your use of Discord. The new terms go into effect on <strong>March 27, 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s been updated:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhanced readability.</strong> We believe that the best Terms are the ones that are easy to read and understand. With that goal in mind, we’ve reworded, reformatted, reorganized, re– you get the point. We made changes so that it’s easier for you to follow along.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Better description of our services.</strong> We added in more details on how Discord works – from how users communicate to how activities are shared. Gameplay sharing, for example, is on by default (who doesn’t want to watch you winning?), but you can deactivate it at any time. We also added information on how we personalize your experience and how you can customize that.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Improved dispute resolution. </strong>We’ve updated our informal dispute resolution process and our arbitration agreement to lay out more detail on the steps you should take in case you have a dispute. We work hard to make sure you always love Discord and hope there’s never a dispute, but if there is, we believe that most disputes can be resolved quickly and informally.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Protections against Risky Business. </strong>No, not that 80’s movie. We’re just saying out loud that we might discontinue a feature, remove content, or close an account if it poses a risk to our business. We also elaborate on what types of provisions survive in case of termination of these terms.
