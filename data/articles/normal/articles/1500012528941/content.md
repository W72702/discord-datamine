<h1 id="h_01F6T5F5EKZTZ13QVJGDJZ1217">What is the pronoun bot for?</h1>
<p>Discord is a place where millions of people around the world come to find community, explore their interests, and hang out together - sometimes with their friends, and sometimes with soon-to-be-friends (a.k.a. strangers). We know that it can be difficult to know how to refer to new people you meet (profile pics and nicknames only get you so far) and even more difficult to correct people if they identify you incorrectly.</p>
<p>Having pronouns displayed makes it easier for communities to provide welcoming spaces for their users, because when people make assumptions about gender identity, it can be <a class="ql-link" href="https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc" data-slab-linktype="text">harmful and painful</a>. Displaying pronouns is also an act of compassion and solidarity with those who need to express themselves and their identities in order to be seen and referred to correctly.</p>
<p>The pronoun picker bot is an easy, off-the-shelf solution for server admins who want to enable users to self-select their pronouns if they are interested in doing so. Using our <a class="ql-link" href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012250861-Bots-Buttons" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc" data-slab-linktype="text">brand-new Buttons</a> for bots, assigning pronouns to your profile or nickname has never been easier.</p>
<p>We hope this helps everyone feel a little more comfortable, a little more expressive, and a little more knowledgeable! Happy 2021 Pride!</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In order to add the pronoun bot to your server, make sure to follow these step below!</p>
<ul>
    <li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Start by <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=832258414603534380&amp;permissions=8&amp;scope=bot%20applications.commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clicking on this link right here</a>
    </li>
    <li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Select the server you'd like from the drop-down list in the <strong>Add to Server</strong> section</li>
    <li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Once selected, then press <strong>Continue</strong>
    </li>
    <li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In the next window, confirm the permissions request by pressing the <strong>Authorize</strong> button</li>
    <li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">And that's it! When you head back to your server, you'll now see the pronoun bot in your Member's List</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019908161/authorizing_bot_process_screenshot.png" alt="authorizing_bot_process_screenshot.png" width="439" height="672"></p>
<h3>
    <strong>Note:</strong> <br>- You will need to be the server owner or have Manage Server permissions in the server in order to add the bot. <br>- If you do not have those permissions, the server will not appear in the Add to Server options. 
</h3>
<h1 id="h_01F6T5FA2C1T264ZPDSP8N6HX4">How do I use the pronoun bot?</h1>
<p>There are two ways to use the bot:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>As a user in a server:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>When you see the bot's post in a channel, just click or tap the button with your pronoun. That's it! (The bot will assign it for you and display it in the location chosen by your server admin - either as a role on your profile or in your nickname.)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>As a server admin or moderator:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the customization side of the pronoun bot. If you have server permissions, you'll be able to use our nifty <a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.discord.com/slash-commands-are-here-8db0a385d9e6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc" data-slab-linktype="text">Slash Commands</a> to set up the pronoun options so they are a good fit for your community's needs.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5FPPHHJ45Q3N2X38A712D">Do I have to customize it?</h2>
<p>Nope! If you don't make any changes, this is what the pronoun bot's default prompt will be:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019844601/buttons.png" alt="buttons.png"></p>
<p>The default pronoun options are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They/Them</li>
    <li>She/Her</li>
    <li>He/Him</li>
    <li>Any</li>
    <li>Ask Me</li>
    <li>Pick Multiple (which will then allow the user to interact with more than one button and get assigned multiple pronouns).</li>
</ul>
<p>The default location where the pronouns will be displayed is on a user's profile as roles.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5FW68JQW9VSQE71GWJK6S">How do I get the bot to display the pronoun prompt for my users?</h2>
<p>The prompt (and all of the bot configuration) is easily done using Slash Commands.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you're new to Slash Commands, all these means is that you <strong>type a forward slash (/)</strong> in the text box, which will automatically bring up what we call the command picker.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the bots currently in your server (that have Slash Commands enabled) will have their commands displayed alphabetically on this list - you'll see a Wumpus with gorgeous hair and a list of straightforward commands to choose from.</p>
<p>If you're looking just to post the prompt, choose the <strong>/prompt</strong> command, and the post shown in the image above will be posted in your channel for users to engage with.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5G1HS1H0K33WFV85ZWZ8J">Can I change the pronoun options for my server?</h2>
<p>Yes—just use these commands mentioned below! </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>To add new pronouns:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the <strong>/pronouns add</strong> command. Then type the text you want to be displayed in your new Button and hit 'enter.'</li>
            <li>You can add up to 12 additional options (on top of the default set of 3, in blurple), for a total of 15 configurable Buttons. (The gray Buttons are non-configurable.)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019844641/slash_commands.png" alt="slash_commands.png"></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>To remove pronouns:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the <strong>/pronouns remove</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you change your mind, you can always choose the <strong>/pronouns reset</strong> command, which will remove all pronouns except for the default set of 6.
</h3>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5G8J9DK4269P9QF5ZGNNK">Can I use or change emojis on my Buttons?</h2>
<p>Adding or replacing an emoji is optional, but if you want to customize the default Buttons with different emojis - or add new pronouns with their own emojis - this is also quick and easy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>To replace or add an emoji for default or existing Button:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose <strong>/pronouns emoji</strong> and type the name of the existing pronoun, then select 'emoji' (or hit 'tab' to move forward to the emoji field) and put in the emoji you'd like displayed on the Button.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>To remove emojis from Buttons</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the same flow (<strong>/pronouns emoji</strong>) but type '<strong>remove</strong>' in the emoji field. This will remove the pronoun.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5GH35Y0T71H6WXJFXBCFD">How are the pronouns I select displayed for me?</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019844681/roles.png" alt="roles.png"></p>
<p>The default setting is for pronouns to be displayed as roles, but those with permissions to customize the bot can choose to change this to an alternative option: adding to the nickname field.</p>
<p>To do this, choose the <strong>/config edit</strong> command, and for <strong>use-roles</strong> choose "<strong>false</strong>." This will switch the default to the other display option.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019571302/members_list.png" alt="members_list.png"></p>
<p>At any time, you can choose <strong>/config reset</strong> to return to the bot's default settings.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5GXQ6YW1TN3Z1SEC6085N">How do I change the text displayed within the prompt?</h2>
<p>To do this, choose the <strong>/config edit</strong> command, and for <strong>prompt-message</strong> simply type the text you want to display in the bot prompt.</p>
<p>We recommend something that invites users to click our cool new Buttons!</p>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5H9C1WGGZWWAP5BB6SD9X">How do I test what my prompt looks like before I post it for my users?</h2>
<p>To do this, choose the <strong>/config view</strong> command.</p>
<p>This will display an ephemeral message (one only you can see and no one else) so you can check whether the bot will use roles or nicknames, reread the text within the prompt, and also check the permissions for who can customize the bot prompt.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019844781/config.png" alt="config.png"></p>
<h2 id="h_01F6T5HGK6XPFF6CYQH4BQ1YZB">What's the difference between the blurple buttons and the gray buttons?</h2>
<p>The blurple buttons are configurable - you can remove the default three blurple buttons or you can add up to 12 more, for a total of 15 configurable buttons.</p>
<h1 id="h_01F6T5HQ91DBBZ2JJF0WFYEZB9">Anything I should watch out for?</h1>
<p>Note that if multiple people have permission to customize the bot, and they use commands to reconfigure the prompt set up at the same time, these commands will be overridden and only the most recent choices will be saved.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion, we recommend that only one person customize the bot - and be careful not to change the bot permissions to a role that too many people within the server have (otherwise you'll have quite a few bot prompts being changed around and posted).</p>
