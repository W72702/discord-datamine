<p>When you're not ready to start a server, but you still want to share goofy gifs with some friends... That's where group invites have you covered. </p>
<h1>Group Invites</h1>
<p>Your gif sharing group is ready to go, but it needs more members! Any group member who is currently on a computer will be able to create an invite link by clicking the <strong>Add Friends</strong> icon at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>Once you have created your invite link - you're ready to share it with the world. It will appear very similar to a server invite.</p>

<h3>Note: If your group fills up (10 members) the invite link will no longer work. </h3>
<p>Even though you can only make group invites on a computer, you can use them to join a chat on any version of Discord!</p>
<h1>Group Invite Management</h1>
<p>Group DM owners, you have some special powers! As the owner of the DM you'll be able to help manage any invites that have been created. Right-click the icon for your group DM and select <strong>Instant Invite</strong>.</p>

<p>Instant invite links for group DMs will automatically <strong>expire after 48 hours</strong>, however, the owner will be able to click the X next to an invite to deactivate it.</p>

<h3>Note: If an invitee is blocked by the inviter, they will not be able to use the Group DM invite link.</h3>
