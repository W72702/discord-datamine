<p>If you would like to request a copy of the personal data you've given us over the lifetime of your account, you can do so by going to <strong>User Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Privacy and Safety </strong>and clicking the "Request all of my Data" button. This button exists everywhere you can use Discord (Desktop App, Browser, and on Mobile!).</p>

<p>When you hit the button, Discord will receive a request to collect all of your user data. There a few things to know when requesting a copy of your data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Requesting your data may take <strong>up to</strong> <strong>30 days</strong> to process!</li>
    <li>You can't make a request while a request is pending. </li>
    <li>When it's ready, we will send a link to download your data to the email address you had when you submitted the request. <em>Changing your email address later will not redirect the download link.</em>
    </li>
    <li>If you disable or delete your account before you receive your download link, it will cancel your request!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Please note: You must complete email verification on your Discord account in order to be able to make a request for your data!</h3>
