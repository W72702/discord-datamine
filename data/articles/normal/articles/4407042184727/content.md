<h1 id="h_01FDXAPAC01NA7BN8T2FEYNG29">What is this experiment?</h1>
<p>A selected group of creators, influencers, and partnered communities will have the ability to share a unique affiliate link with their followers and communities. </p>
<p>You can click these affiliate links in-app (desktop or web only) or across the creator's other platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) and you will be prompted to subscribe to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nitro ($9.99</a>).</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds from users who successfully subscribe through their link will go directly to the affiliate.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FDXAPJC4DCPBJK6SJAEXNWXG">Who is Eligible?</h2>
<p>Only <strong>new Nitro subscribers</strong> are eligible to use affiliate links in order to subscribe. If you are not a new Nitro subscriber, you will be able to subscribe through the link, but the creator will not receive a part of the profit from it. More information is in the <a href="#h_01FDX907P1JW26EVV1CGKXJE1M" target="_self">Redemption Process</a> section below.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FDXAPQCWDVJ9EVVQC7SV2QGW">Who is Ineligible?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Current (active) Nitro, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting subscribers.</li>
    <li>Users who have activated a Nitro Tier 2 ($9.99) Gift on their account in the past. </li>
    <li>Users who have subscribed to Nitro Tier 2 ($9.99) in the past.</li>
    <li>Users who have previously activated a different trial or promotion on their account (EGS, Xbox Promo, Youtube Premium Promo, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01FDX907P1JW26EVV1CGKXJE1M">REDEMPTION PROCESS</h1>
<p>Affiliate links can be shared to their communities by the affiliates on whichever social media platforms they operate, such as YouTube or Twitter, and also directly over Discord. Users can simply click the link to start the process!</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4407042401047/accept_modal.png" alt="accept_modal.png"></p>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">If you already have an active subscription</span></strong></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">If you <strong>previously subscribed to Nitro but no longer have a subscription</strong> you will be able to continue to subscribe but the sub<strong> will not</strong> qualify in order for the affiliate to receive part of the proceeds. You will see the following:</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4407048547223/not_eligible_modal.png" alt="not_eligible_modal.png"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">If the link is expired or invalid:</span></strong></p>

<h2 id="h_01FDXAQ8TAHJ8PM2SH936RRA7Z">On iOS</h2>
<p>The purchase flow is <strong>NOT supported</strong> on the Discord <strong>iOS app or in-app browser</strong>. ("in-app browser" here is referring to a browser window that is opened directly through a non-browser app by clicking a link.) </p>
<p>You can also directly paste the affiliate link into a Mobile Web browser, such as Safari if you do not have access to a PC or Laptop. You will then be prompted to log in to Discord through there in order to subscribe.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4407042791191/ios_link.png" alt="ios_link.png"></p>
<h2 id="h_01FDXAQFT7N65MC4NF7QZXCCJ7">On Android</h2>
<p>On any Android app (whether it's the Discord app or an external app), the affiliate link will show. However, tapping on the link will open an in-app browser, and you will need to log in through that browser in order to subscribe.</p>
<h3>Note: Subscribing with an affiliate link through Google Play is not supported at this time.</h3>
