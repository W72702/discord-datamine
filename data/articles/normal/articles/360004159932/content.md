<p>Before using your Microphone for Voice Calls, and your Camera for Video Calls, you may have to grant permission for apps to access your Microphone and Camera. This guide will show you how!</p>
<p><br>To get started, go into <strong>Windows Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone AND Camera</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll see two toggles under the "<em>Allow apps to access your camera/microphone</em>," turn both of these to "<strong>On</strong>" and voilà!</p>

<p>You've just enabled permission for apps to use both! Do a little happy dance, you've earned it!</p>
