<h2 class="p1">Now Playing Status</h2>
<p>When using Spotify to display the song you're listening to as a status message, you may see errors with the song display in your status message! The incorrect song may be displayed, or the length of the song and your place in the song may be displayed incorrectly.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Listening Parties and Listen Along</h2>
<p>When inviting your friends to listen to songs with you, or joining a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003966072" target="_self">listen along</a> session, users might end up being placed in the wrong part of the song. Alternatively, you might end up hearing the previous song played by the host of the party!<br><br>While our team resolves this bug, disconnecting and reconnecting Spotify from your Discord account typically gets things working, at least temporarily! You can remove a Spotify account by visiting <strong>User Settings &gt; Connections </strong>and removing Spotify using the x. Then, add your account again using the Spotify icon!</p>
