<h3><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">You can also copy and paste a GIF or image URL into chat, and the link preview will display said image.  </span></h3>
<h2 id="h_01GWWTHJMX8ZDJ1SBKK9ZV17VG">Drag &amp; Drop</h2>
<p>The first way to upload an image into Discord is simple - Just drag an image or GIF from another source and drop it into the Discord window. This can be done on the browser or desktop app!  </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/13527114627735" alt="drag_and_drop_example.gif"></p>
<p>If you're having trouble dragging your picture or have to dig a little deeper to find it, then we can try another method, leading us to...</p>
<h2 id="h_01GWWTHPMEJJ8W9YPRD0JD64R2">Upload From File</h2>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">To manually upload a file, you can select the little arrow box right next to the text box. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Then maneuver through your folders until you find the image you're looking for. Double-click or select &amp; hit open, whichever way suits you best.</span></p>

<p>Whether you're uploading via Drag &amp; Drop or file upload, you'll have the opportunity to add a comment to the file before uploading it. Which will go over a little bit more under <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Add Alt Text To Your Image Upload.</span></p>

<p>Remember, to keep Discord running super smooth and awesome, we have to keep any picture files and embedded media files below 25MB. With Nitro, you’ll get a higher upload limit. Otherwise, you're free to bombard your friends with your favorite pics to your heart's content!</p>

<p>After you choose the image you want to upload, you can add alt text to the image. Alt text is a short text description that you provide for your image, which is helpful for your friends or community who may be visually impaired and rely on a screen reader. Even for users that don’t need a screen reader, image descriptions are good to have for those with sensory/learning disabilities or in place of an image that doesn’t properly load in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="h_01GWWTJ313QZXE8KY5XS3HYN8G">Desktop</h2>
<p>After you choose the image you want to upload, press on the pencil icon to Modify Attachment at the corner of the upload preview.</p>
<p>In the in-app pop-up, type in the Description (Alt Text) a brief description of your image. Press Save then upload your image!</p>

<h2 id="h_01GWWTJEKMRPV2VKJPQFXRP835">When writing image alt text, there a few things to keep in mind:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Aim to be succinct and specific! Avoid repeating details.</li>
    <li>Don’t start the alt text with “image of…” or “picture of…” since screen readers will usually announce that an image is a “graphic” then state the provided alt text.</li>
    <li>Make sure to call out specific details. For example, state any text that’s in the image and the names of prominent figures, landmarks, etc. if they are in the image.</li>
    <li>Context is key! When describing the image, describe what the image is supposed to communicate to viewers, not just what is literally in the image.</li>
</ul>
