<h2 id="h_01F2HKTD57FVC60P8B8JW6FTKX">What is Discord Testers?</h2>
<p>Discord Testers (also known as DTesters) is an official, invite only Discord server for adept volunteer bug testers. Our goal is to identify, reproduce, and provide high-quality bug reports. While there is no minimum activity expectation, inactive members may be removed. We're sorry to say that the opportunity to be considered for the Discord Testers server is currently unavailable. Periodically, new testers will be added and more information will be provided here as these opportunities arise.</p>
<p>For those who filled out the most recent Discord Testers Consideration Quiz, we are in the process of reviewing the completed quizzes. When the review process is complete, we will update this page with more information. This process will take time, and we appreciate your patience.</p>

<p><strong>How can I report bugs if I am not a part of the Discord Testers server?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bug reports should be submitted with a ticket to the </span><a href="https://dis.gd/bugreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Reporting Form</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Be sure to fill out each category, as each is important.</span></p>
<p><strong>Are members of the Discord Testers server required to have previous experience?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the Discord Testers server are expected to have submitted quality bug reports prior to joining the server.</span></p>
<p><strong>Are DTesters required to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA)?Â  Why?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTesters may be asked to test features that have not yet been released.Â  Due to the sensitive nature, an NDA is required to be signed.Â  If an invitation is extended to you, you are welcome to review the details of the NDA so you can decide whether to sign or not.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is the time and submission requirement for a Discord Tester?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTesters are volunteers, and as such, we want to encourage them to find balance between DTesters activities and personal lives.Â  There is currently no minimum activity requirement, but complete inactivity for a long period of time may result in removal.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is the minimum age requirement for DTesters?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord users must be 13 years of age.Â  If a Discord Tester is between 13 and 18 years of age, a parent or guardian will need to sign the NDA as well as the tester.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can I be a Discord Tester even if I donâ€™t live in the United States?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord is a place for all to find belonging, and we have DTesters from all around the world.Â  Clear written communication in English is necessary at this time.Â </span></p>
<p><strong>Can I join DTesters if I donâ€™t want to participate in bug reporting/testing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new version of DTesters is for adept and active bug reporters/testers.</span></p>
<p><strong>How do I get a Bug Hunter Badge?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bug Hunter Badges are available to Discord Testers who meet specific requirements.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can I prepare to be a tester?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the Discord Bugs article for guidance on the elements of a quality bug report.Â  Keep in mind that the most helpful bug reports are those that affect the usability and enjoyment of Discord.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why was the original format of the DTesters server changed?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original Discord Testers was a vast community of bug testers and curious folks alike, making it challenging to facilitate great communication.Â  Additionally, the size and scope of interests meant that the features that could be tested were limited. Weâ€™ve updated the program in order to provide more enjoyment and participation opportunities to the most active testers in the community.</span></p>
