<p>Setting up a role-exclusive channel is integral to conducting official guild business without alarming the rest of the troops. With the correct settings, your guild members shall not pass without your explicit permission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong><u>Step 1: </u></strong><u>Create </u><u>a role (Optional)</u></span></p>
<p>If you <strong>already</strong> have a role that you'd like to give super special access to, then <strong>skip</strong> the creation step and move on to <strong>step 2.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you do not already have a role set up that deserves this exclusive status, then open <strong>Server Settings &gt; Roles</strong> and <strong>create a new role</strong> for your secret channel by clicking the <strong>"+"</strong> sign next to Roles. </p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong><u>Step 2:</u></strong><u> </u><u>Administer Role</u></span></p>
<p>Next, open the <strong>"Members"</strong> tab and use your sorting hat abilities to <strong>administer</strong> this new role to the appropriate people by clicking on the "<strong>+" </strong>sign next to their name then selecting the <strong>new role</strong> (in this example,<strong> "Leader" role)</strong> from the <strong>drop down</strong> menu.</p>

<p><em>Note: If you don't see any or all names in the members tab, make sure that <strong>@everyone </strong>is selected in the top right.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong><u>Step 3: </u></strong><u>Create a Super Secret channel</u></span> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-large">Text Channel:</span></p>
<p>Click on the <strong>"+"</strong> icon next to <strong>"Text Channels."</strong></p>
<p><strong> <img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008105891/3_.jpg" alt="3_.jpg"></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Type in the <strong>new channel name</strong> and select the <strong>role</strong> that has a VIP pass and will only be able to access this channel. Finally, click <strong>create</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008105911/4_.jpg" alt="4_.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now members with the "<strong>Leaders"</strong> role are the <strong>only</strong> people who have access to this channel! Users who <strong>do not have</strong> the ability to access this channel will <strong>not see it</strong> on their channel list.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Voice Channel:</span></span></p>
<p>To add a role <strong>exclusive</strong> <strong>voice channel</strong>, follow these same steps except <strong>create</strong> a <strong>new</strong> <strong>voice channel</strong> instead of text channel by clicking the <strong>"+"</strong> button next to <strong>"Voice channels."</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008065472/5_.jpg" alt="5_.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you click the <strong>"+"</strong> button, the <strong>same window</strong> will appear as above asking for the <strong>new channel name</strong>, as well as <strong>selecting</strong> which role(s) you'd like to <strong>give</strong> channel <strong>access</strong> to. </p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008065752/6_.jpg" alt="6_.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">What does it all mean, Discord?</span></span></p>
<p>This box is meant to make your life easier by setting up <strong>basic channel permissions </strong>for you, thus allowing <strong>restricted</strong> <strong>access</strong> to the role or roles that are selected. To find out which <strong>permissions</strong> are adjusted, click on the <strong>cog wheel icon</strong> next to the channel you just created.</p>
<p> <img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008106611/7_.jpg" alt="7_.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, click on the <strong>"Permissions" tab</strong> and you'll see that the <strong>@everyone</strong> role has been <strong>denied</strong> permissions to <strong>"read messages."</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008065972/8_.jpg" alt="8_.jpg" width="1046" height="655"> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Likewise, clicking on the role that's been <strong>given</strong> access to the channel will show that they have been <strong>granted</strong> permission to <strong>"read messages."</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008065992/9_.jpg" alt="9_.jpg" width="1051" height="648"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>difference</strong> in the <strong>basic permissions</strong> for a <strong>voice channel versus a text channel</strong> is instead of <strong>"read messages,"</strong> the <strong>"connect"</strong> permission will either be green-lighted or denied. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">@Everyone:</span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008066012/10_.jpg" alt="10_.jpg" width="1047" height="638"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">@Leaders:</span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360008106651/11_.jpg" alt="11_.jpg" width="1049" height="653"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike text channels, people who <strong>can't access</strong> a <strong>voice channel</strong> will still be able to <strong>see</strong> the channel in their list. Upon hovering their cursor over the channel name though, they'll be greeted with a <strong>big no</strong> (aka circle with a slash).  </p>
