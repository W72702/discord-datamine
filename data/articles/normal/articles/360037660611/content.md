<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You all know and love our Safety Officer Jim. He's here to give you another reminder, and this time it's about scam/phishing bots. <br><br>If you receive a Direct Message from a bot offering you something, or asking you to click on a link, disregard it! We have never created a bot designed to offer you free products, so you can safely determine that this is a scam. Do not add these bots to your server in hopes of receiving something in return as they likely will compromise your server. If anything gets deleted, we have no way of restoring what was lost!<br><br>Whenever you're curious about a bot, your best bet is to reach out to the developer. If you're unsure of how to proceed, or your account gets compromised, you should reach out to our support team. Options to reach our support team are listed at the bottom of this page.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If a bot is contacting you to be added to your server, or asking you to click on a suspicious link, please <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> this to our Trust &amp; Safety team so they can investigate it.</h3>
