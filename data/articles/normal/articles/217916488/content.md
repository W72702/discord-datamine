<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Friends? Friends are great. Communities too. Things can get a little sticky when you get big bunches of friends and bigger communities, and some less-than-savory types join the fray. Luckily, we've been ramping up Discord's privacy settings to give you some control and up your hater-blocking game.</p>
<h1>Blocking Direct Messages</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium">The first part of privacy settings is the <strong>Privacy Settings</strong> menu. Click the little down arrow next to the server name and you'll find this drop-down menu window:</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360062791992/Screen_Shot_2020-07-24_at_10.46.26_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-07-24_at_10.46.26_AM.png" width="395" height="512"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In addition to being able to adjust notification and server settings, you can adjust privacy settings on a <strong>per-server</strong> basis as well. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Selecting/deselecting this option <strong>lets you block DMs (Direct Messages) from users in that server that isn't on your friend's list.</strong> Normally, sharing a mutual server is all it takes to allow DMs. This option can filter out anyone you don't want to hear from.</p>

<h1>Blocking Users - Desktop Instructions</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In the case that you generally like everyone in a server (except for a few individuals), the DM list has a quick-access menu to a user's profile!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In your DM chat, clicking the @Username will bring up the user's profile! <span class="wysiwyg-color-black70">You can click the three dots in the top right to pull up a menu that will let you block the user.</span></p>

<h1>On Friend Requests</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Last stop on the damage control tour of Discord's settings is adjusting friend request privileges. To find this menu, open up your <strong>User Settings</strong> and click the <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> tab:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360064193951/2.png" alt="2.png"></p>
<h1>Allowed Friend Requests</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Here you can set who's allowed to send you a friend request:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002765292/mceclip2.png" width="649" height="224"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Everyone:</strong></span> Selecting <em>Everyone</em> means that anyone who knows your DiscordTag or is in a mutual server with you can send you a request. Having this selected will automatically include both <em>Friends of Friends</em> and <em>Server Members</em> options.<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><br></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Friends of Friends:</strong></span> Selecting this means that for anyone to add you, they must have at least one mutual friend with you. You can view this in their user profile by clicking the <em>Mutual Friends</em> tab next to the <em>Mutual Servers</em> tab: </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360062974271/Screen_Shot_2020-07-24_at_12.33.54_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-07-24_at_12.33.54_PM.png" width="531" height="361"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Server Members:</strong></span> Selecting server members means users who share a server with you can send you a friend request. Deselecting this means that you can only be added by someone with mutual friends as you.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><em><strong>Note:</strong> Friends of Friends and Server members can be both selected or deselected, allowing you to customize what avenues you are willing to receive friend requests. If you only want to add friends on your prerogative, you can deselect all three options, and not receive ANY requests. </em></h3>
