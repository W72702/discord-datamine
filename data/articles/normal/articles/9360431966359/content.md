<h1 id="h_01GFK7PET06SD1150YGNJPH8N0">What is the App Directory?</h1>
<p>The App Directory lets you search, browse, and explore thousands of apps to customize your server, directly in Discord!</p>
<p>With apps, you can customize and personalize your server, automate useful tasks to free up time, and add fun and delight to your community.</p>
<p>New apps are being added regularly as developers enable their apps to be discovered, so keep an eye out for that next rad app to level up your server.</p>
<h1 id="h_01GFK7PTNE49GJ3GZEX5265EXQ">Getting to the App Directory</h1>
<p>The directory can be accessed in three ways on the desktop client:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#h_01GFK7QWDM2FNAZ9A4E1KGXVB3" target="_self">From the Server List</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h_01GFK7R4EAVBBKCW9PP28GQB9H" target="_self">From the Server Settings Window</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h_01GFK7RAYW3DY1DVC9NHNTQYN3" target="_self">From the Server Menu</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01GFK7QWDM2FNAZ9A4E1KGXVB3">From the Server List</h2>
<p>Right-click the server’s icon in the server list on the far left-hand side of Discord.</p>
<p>Then hover over the Server Settings and choose the App Directory in the pop-out menu.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789389540247" alt="app-directory-server-icon-demo.gif"></p>
<h2 id="h_01GFK7R4EAVBBKCW9PP28GQB9H">From the Server Settings Window</h2>
<p>Left-click the server name located at the top left corner of Discord.</p>
<p>Then you can go to the Server Settings and then select the App Directory on the left-hand menu.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789389542807" alt="app-directory-server-settings-demo.gif"></p>
<h2 id="h_01GFK7RAYW3DY1DVC9NHNTQYN3">From the Server Menu</h2>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/9506163623447" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-06_at_8.48.55_AM.png" width="380" height="640"></p>
<h1 id="h_01GFK7PZ5B0DHDVQ1C0DEWSWAA">Navigating the App Directory</h1>
<h2>Browse Collections</h2>
<p>The homepage of the App Directory includes various collections of apps that are intended to tell a story about things that Discord users do every day. From having game nights with friends, to growing your communities, to creating things together--we know that all these things can be made better with apps.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789603003927" alt="updated-App-Directory-recommendations.png"></p>
<p>These apps are a mix of community favorites and others we think you’ll love, including some made by companies we work with directly. Sometimes this may include a financial relationship; we’ll identify those apps to you in the Directory with a tag like "Partner". This does not include Premium App Subscriptions, as described below.</p>
<p>We encourage you to check back regularly as we update the collections with new apps!</p>
<h2>Browse by Category</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a certain type of app, you can also browse by category, as listed at the top of the homepage.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789638930711" alt="updated-app-directory-categories.png"></p>
<p>Apps are sorted into relevant categories using a model informed by app names, descriptions, tags, and other information provided by developers, and results are listed in order of popularity based on the number of servers they’re in.</p>
<h2>Browse by Searching Specific Terms</h2>
<p>You can also search through the whole catalog of apps in the Directory using specific terms in the search bar.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12789602958487" alt="updated-Triva-search-results-app-directory.png"></p>
<p>Search results are generally determined using a model informed by app names, descriptions, tags, and other information provided by developers, and are listed in order of relevancy to the search term and popularity based on the number of servers they’re in.</p>
<p>Results for some search terms, like music, may also be further filtered based on information provided by developers to offer greater relevancy and reliability—these result pages will look different than the standard list above.</p>
<h1>App Product Pages</h1>
<p>Each app in the Directory also has its own product page. There you’ll find useful information about the app (like what categories the app belongs to, where you can find the developer’s website and social accounts, popular slash commands, and so on) as well as a way to add the app to your server. There may even be an invite to a Discord server where you can try out the app or receive support. The developer of the app is responsible for its product page (e.g., the descriptions, images, videos, links, etc.), and ensuring it is accurate and up-to-date. If you have any questions or issues relating to the app or its product page, please reach out to the developer through their support channel.</p>
<p>You may also notice that a few apps offer subscriptions to Premium Features you can purchase through Discord, offering you new levels of customization and functionality. Premium App Subscriptions are a new feature we are testing and rolling out slowly. <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9359445233303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more here</a>.</p>
<p>At the bottom of each app product page, you’ll find suggestions of similar apps you may also like. These suggestions are generated by a model informed by the app product page you’re on, including the categories the app is in, the other apps in those categories, and the number of servers the app is in.</p>
<h1 id="h_01GWTJQK4FGPJ5X7TCT27F0JTA">Sharing Apps with Others</h1>
<p>While Admins are responsible for adding an App to a server, anyone can share an app they love with others.</p>
<p>To do so, you simply go to the specific app’s product page in the App Directory:</p>
<p>1. Go to the App Directory following the instructions in the <a href="#h_01GFK7PTNE49GJ3GZEX5265EXQ" target="_self">Getting to the App Directory</a> section.</p>
<p>2. Search or go to the product page of the desired App you want to share. You can follow the steps in the <a href="#h_01GFK7PZ5B0DHDVQ1C0DEWSWAA" target="_self">Navigating the App Directory</a> section for how to find the app product page.</p>

<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Copy Link to Cool App product page</h4>
<p>4. Share the link to the app with your friends or server admin by pasting the link in a text channel or text chat in voice channel! The link will have a neat embed for the app when you send it in a text channel or text chat.</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-bb96ec06-7fff-604c-7f9f-be8782ea34ec">From there, your admin can add the Cool App to your server for all members to enjoy!</span></p>
