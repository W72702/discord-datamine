<p><em>What are the types of servers </em></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Friend Server</strong>: Friend Servers are invite-only spaces designed to discuss, connect, and share with your friends or smaller groups. Invite links in Friend Servers will expire at a maximum of 30 days, though previously created non-expiring links will remain active and functional. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Community Server: </strong>Community Servers are invite-only spaces designed for people to share, connect, and learn from others all over the world who share common interests. Moderators in Community Servers have access to tools like Server Insights, Raid Protection, Rules and Onboarding.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01H1W0ABM3N9PXPQTDJR5WAZCD">Becoming a Community Server</h2>
<p>Friend Servers who wish to have access to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server#h_01EEK1ERA1EK6KPVEQ7VDW5GN7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community features</a> may opt in to become a Community Server at any time in server settings. </p>
<p><strong>Becoming a Community Server does not mean that anyone can find or join your server. </strong>Prospective members have to be sent an invite link. To support Community Server growth, invite links for Community Servers never expire.</p>
<p>Eligible servers that <em>do</em> want to grow their audience and allow anyone to join can choose to become discoverable via <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Discovery</a> if they meet certain criteria. <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030843331-Enabling-Server-Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find out more</a> and read our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409308485271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Discovery Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>In order for users to know what type of server they’re in, we’ve introduced badges for Community Servers.  </p>
<p>We will display a distinct server badge if the server is a Community Server, a Discoverable Community, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047236171-Partnered-vs-Verified-Servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Partnered Server</a>, or <a href="https://discord.com/verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verified Server</a>. Hovering over the badge will provide more detailed information about the server type, whether anyone can join the server, and the Boost level.</p>

<p>Communities that previously had the “Public” tag, will now have the “Discoverable Community” badge. Servers that are Partnered and Verified will receive the “Verified” badge, and the tooltip will denote both statuses.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><em><span style="background-color: #ffff00;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=""><img style="height: 345px; width: 624px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15027054348695"></span></em></p>

<h1 id="h_01H1W0AFG0KTPNN94FVPEZK156">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Q: What happens with badges if you’re verified and partnered? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">A: We’ll display your Verified badge, and the tooltip will indicate that the server is Verified &amp; Partnered. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Q: Does this mean that partner badges go away?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">A: No. Partner and Verified badges will remain unchanged. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Q: How will I know what type of server I am in? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">A: Community, Partnered and Verified servers will have badges and tooltips that display the server type.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Q: Will Friend Servers be labeled/ badged? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">A: We may consider adding a badge to Friend Servers in a future rollout. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Q: Why are new invite-links capped at 30 days for Friend Servers?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">A: Our research and user feedback found different use cases of invite links for Friends Servers and Community Servers. Typically for Community Servers intending to grow, admins leave up invite links on third-party websites to allow more people to join. However, Friends Servers are more intimate and enclosed spaces where users generate new invite links to send to friends. We found that nearly 100% of links were clicked within 30 days, reducing the likelihood of a negative impact on Friends Servers.</span></p>
