<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since <strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threads</a></strong> are a new surface to consider when moderating servers, we wanted to give our communities the opportunity to choose where and how they can be used. Not every community will want every member to be able to create a Thread, and that’s okay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having control over who can use Threads is important as a server grows in size and scope.</span></p>

<h3>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Later in September, all servers will switch to this new permissions system<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make Threads permissions clearer, we’re now adding a fourth, </span><strong>Send Messages in Threads</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permission. Additionally -</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Public Threads → Create Public Threads</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Private Threads → Create Private Threads</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage Threads (will remain the same)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this additional </span><strong>Send Messages in Threads</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permission, the new behavior is:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">To send a message in a Thread members </span><strong>only</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need the “Send Messages in Threads” permission </span>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The </em><strong><em>Send Messages</em></strong><em> permission will no longer have any direct affect on Threads behavior anymore.</em></span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">To create a thread that anyone in a channel can view, server members </span><strong>only</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need the “Create Public Threads” permission</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">To create a thread that only certain people in a channel can view, server members </span><strong>only</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need the “Create Private Threads” permission</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To moderate threads, server members still need the “Manage Threads” permission</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will see these permissions beginning 8/19/21, and on 8/27/21 you can switch to the new behavior at your own convenience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> <br>- For new guilds, and guilds that haven’t adjusted their role Thread settings already, <em><strong>Create Public Threads, Create Private Threads</strong></em>, and <strong><em>Send Messages</em></strong> in Threads are enabled for <span class="roleMention-2Bj0ju desaturate-qhyunI wrapper-3WhCwL mention" tabindex="-1">@everyone</span> role. <br>- However, if you’ve already designated your permissions by role type, Threads being enabled for all servers should not affect what you have chosen in permission settings.</span></h3>
<h1 id="h_01FBAAVWPHBY1T60KR42DK9HMY"><strong>Core Thread Permissions</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help, we have four </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">permissions</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you fine-tune which members can create threads, and which channels Threads can be made in. </span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send Messages in Threads</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Public Threads</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Private Threads</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage Threads</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4406694312727/image6.png" alt="image6.png" width="535" height="370"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4406694322455/image1.png" alt="image1.png" width="540" height="184"></p>
<h1 id="h_01FBM6Z82HQQ7PV3CCDPKEYC3M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Thread Moderation Management</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, threads inherit permissions from the channel in which they were created. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If members are able to view a channel, then they are also able to view threads in that channel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they have </span><strong>Send Messages in Threads</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permission enabled, then they can send messages in Threads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they have </span><strong>Create Public Threads </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or </span><strong>Create Private Threads</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permission enabled, they can create a thread from an existing message or scratch.</span></p>
<h2>CREATING THREADS</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to create a thread in the server, server members will need either the “Create Public Threads” or “Create Private Threads” permissions. </span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Create Public Threads” permission will allow server members to create threads that can be publicly viewed by others who have access to the text channel. </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Create Private Threads” permission will allow server members to create private threads that can only be accessed by those who are mentioned in the thread!</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>PARTICIPATING IN THREADS</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To send a message within a thread, server members will need the “Send Messages in Thread” permission, which allows server members to participate within threads only - not for all general channels in the server. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the “Send Message” permission will only apply to messages outside of threads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having separate permissions, this allows for some advanced setups, such as allowing server members to participate in threads created off of announcement posts, but not allowing those members to post in the announcement channel!</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01FBM6ZR554F3K8ZKHNW730AQA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderating Threads</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help with moderating threads, we’ve added a new permission, “Manage Threads”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since threads are generally a new form of “content” in a server, we recommend giving this permission to your “content moderators”, which is likely the same people who have the “Manage Messages” permission in your server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creator of a thread, as well as moderators who have the “Manage Threads” permission, will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rename a thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archive a thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove users from a private thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edit the auto-archive duration on a thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restrict who can invite members to a private thread</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderators who have the “Manage Threads” permission will also be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unarchive a thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set slowmode on a thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View all private threads in a channel</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove users from a public thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delete a thread</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01FBM700EDTAGV2B2B1BZVWE9V"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locking down a thread</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes discussion in a thread can get out of hand, and a moderator needs to step in. We’ve built two tools to help with this:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Slowmode</strong></a> can be set on a thread by going to the “Edit” screen, to limit how often folks can send a message in a thread</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">When a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">moderator</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> archives a thread, they can choose to </span><strong>Lock</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a thread, which means only moderators can unarchive them. This provides a way to shut down all discussion in a thread.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, sometimes when creating a private thread and you <strong>don’t</strong> want to allow others to add people to it, you can uncheck the "Anyone can invite" option in the Thread dropdown menu!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4406694114967/image5.png" alt="image5.png" width="423" height="780"></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01FBSVGX50W2FWBRJFZ19RMFT1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow Mode</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord already allows slowmode to be set on a channel. When set, it allows users to only send one message and create one thread within your designated time interval. For example, if you set slowmode to 1 minute, users can only create one thread and send one message per minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for even more granularity, slowmode can also be set for each individual thread. This won’t copy over from the parent channel and only moderators with the “Manage Threads” permission can adjust this setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can set specific slow modes in each individual thread by right-clicking a thread (or by clicking on the three dot symbol at the top of your window), and then selecting <strong>Edit Thread. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then once you're in the Threads Settings menu, you can move the slowmode slider to your desired time interval!</span></p>

<h1 id="h_01FBJE3H1M0DM4KYZ027GDVJF8">Tips for Moderating Threads</h1>
<p>With Threads being a new feature, we wanted to share some tips and tricks to help get you started with moderating Threads and Thread permissions</p>
<p><strong>1. Use the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055709773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Server as Role</a> feature within your Role Settings to test your Thread permissions! </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>With the View as Role feature, you can get a better understanding and see the perspective of what threads are viewable from another role. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Private Threads include <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><em>users</em></strong></span> who have access (not <em>roles</em> who have access) so there may be some discrepancies!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">2. Grant the Manage Threads permissions to moderators and admins to help moderate and manage messages in your server!</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Manage Threads permission allows members to rename, delete, archive/unarchive, turn on slowmode for a thread, and view private threads - this is a great tool to help empower your moderators to manage content in your server. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Create a testing channel for your moderators and server members to experiment with threads!</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>New features are exciting to test for the first time, but it may cause server chaos if Threads are spammed within an already established channel. Having a dedicated testing ground will help avoid both figurative and literal loose Threads. </li>
</ul>
