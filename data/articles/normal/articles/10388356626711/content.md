<h3>This feature is gradually rolling out!</h3>
<h3>Note: If you’re a community member looking to learn more about how to use this feature, check out the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connections &amp; Linked Roles: Community Members</a> article.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We boosted Connections for Discord users and developers: Show off even more details from your connected accounts, and gain new Linked Roles that can grant access to special channels within a server. Admins can now add linked roles to their server via connections or apps to improve the safety and authenticity of members within your community. This creates a better experience for all members and admins alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article is dedicated to </span><strong>Linked Roles</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a feature that will help you secure your server by checking new members’ identities on other platforms you trust. You can also use this to create exclusive spaces for members to hang out in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, checking their presence on other social platforms before allowing them to engage in a channel (e.g. Reddit account age before participating in #RedditorsOnly). </span></p>

<h1 id="h_01GK27ZP8EG1FAHCEPPRWK7A6Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Linked Roles</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create a Linked role, you can head into <strong>Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Create new role &gt; Links.</strong> After creating a new role or clicking on an existing role, you’ll see a new tab at the top labeled <strong>Links.</strong> Here, you can choose the connections you want to require for that role, and what checks you want to run on those connections. Such as, “Twitter account older than 30 days”.</span></p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add multiple requirements to a single <strong>Linked Role</strong> and our system will check that members fulfill <em>all</em> requirements before assigning them the <strong>Linked Role</strong>.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GK27ZXTBBWV3DR422J7HKXQB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merging Existing Roles</span></h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have existing roles that you want to apply requirements to, you can merge these roles together by going into <strong>Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Select the role &gt; Navigate to “Links” tab</strong> and you will be able to modify Connections requirements there.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10899116642455" alt="Roles_-_Links_Tab_-_Existing_Role.png"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that if you modify an existing role that already has members, all members will not need to reverify if 1) they’ve already opted in and 2) passed the requirements - based on the requirements you set up.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GK283CNEYHP4AN52MP7DY00D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linked Roles in Servers</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some servers can be set up to have channels gated with a Linked Role. In order to receive the role and get access to the channel, members will need to verify their account with Connections before entering or writing in the channel. You can go to: Channel Settings &gt; Permissions &gt; Add Members or Roles &gt; Select a Linked Role.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10899151648791" alt="Channel_Permissions.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a channel is gated behind a Linked Role, members will need to meet all requirements before they’re assigned the role to gain access to the Linked Role-gated channels. </span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GK28DV4070WQT2ZWW4EAF69A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linked Role Tags</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members within these channels will have a Role Tag show up next to their usernames in chat. This Linked Role Tag will show the name of the linked role to everyone else in the server. Users can hover over this Linked Role Tag to see the checks that the user passed to get this role.</span></p>

<h1 id="h_01GK28EMFYFKM4DT7MTFJZC765"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps with Connection Capabilities</span></h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve extended connection capabilities to apps (beyond the ones you see in <strong>User Settings &gt; Connections</strong>. Admins can add apps to their server with these capabilities and may decide that you need to connect with them to be granted a particular linked role in the server. Context is key when it comes to trust, so we wanted to enable any kind of connection so that your community can ensure safety in whatever way is specific to your community. See more in the API documentation <a href="http://discord.com/build/linked-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see a collection of some apps that have connection capabilities check out the collections page in the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9360431966359-Welcome-to-the-App-Directory-#h_01GFK7PTNE49GJ3GZEX5265EXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Directory</a>.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GK28ETKK06CTMFN6JJQJ98A5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequently Asked Questions</span></h1>
<p><strong>Q: What permissions do I need in order to modify Linked Roles for existing roles?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Only those with Administrator permissions, or the </span><strong>Manage Roles</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permission, in the server will be able to merge existing roles with Linked Roles.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What permissions do I need in order to gate a channel behind Linked Roles?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Similar to modifying Linked Roles for roles, you will need to make sure you have either Administrator permissions, or the </span><strong>Manage Channels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permission, to gate channel access behind desired Linked Roles.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: If Linked Roles are modified for a role, will server members immediately lose access to a Linked Roles-gated channel?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes. Similar to modifying server roles, modifications to Linked Roles will immediately change access to Linked Roles-gated channels.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on how many Linked Roles can a channel have?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: At this time, there are no restrictions to how many Linked Roles a channel can have.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Linked roles be created based on when a member joined Discord or when they joined the server?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: At this time, Linked Roles can not be created based on a user’s activity on Discord. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I see when a member has a Linked Role in the server?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Members who pass the checks for a Linked Role will not automatically show up in the role’s member list. Members will need to opt-in to the Linked Role by going to the Linked Roles tab under Server Settings, select the Linked Role of interest, and connect to the necessary accounts. This ensures that members actually want the role, rather than auto-assigning them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I see how many members have verified themselves with Connections in server insights?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: At this time, no.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I allow one channel to check for one type of Linked Role and another channel with a different kind of Linked Role?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes! You can set up different Linked Roles per role. The role checks determine the Linked Role for entering the channel.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Which 3rd party App Connections are available today?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Jefit, Bloxlink, Solana, DeviantArt, Charlemagne, Captcha.bot</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be more connections available?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes! We are actively talking to many partners about making new connections available. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can developers build their own connections?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes, we opened up </span><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an API for all developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build any connection they want. With this, developers and admins can enable trust in their own individual communities and create Linked Roles based on these connections.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I set up Linked Roles on mobile?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: At this time, admins can not set up Linked roles on mobile.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do members get Linked Roles?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: At this time, the only way for a member to get a Linked Role is for you to go to the Linked Roles tab under Server Settings. They need to then click on the channel and pass checks in order to receive the Linked Role.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I see what the experience looks like for my members after I gate a channel on a Linked Role?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: As an admin, you automatically have access to all channels, regardless of role. Therefore, in order to view the experience as a normal member, you can either use an alt account or use the “view server as role” functionality and choose a role without admin permissions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I have an existing role that I want to continue giving channel access to, but want to gate access to new members based on a Connection check?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can create a Linked Role, and add both roles to the channel (the existing role </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the new Linked Role). All new members will see the Linked Role flow and need to verify, but existing role members will continue to get access. Members can also DM you for access and you can add them manually to the existing role, which will bypass the Linked Role.</span></p>
