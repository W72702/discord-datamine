<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When trying to install a game purchased from a server, you may run into an error like the one below! It's possible the install directory is above the allowed 260 character limit resulting in the error: "</span><strong>This game has file names too long for Windows. Please select a shorter install directory</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">." </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360022998851/Untitled1.png" alt="Untitled1.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially common for a game with a long name.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get past this error all you’ll need to do is </span><strong>install the game to a drive or location with a shorter path</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example like your Desktop. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should do it! </span></p>
