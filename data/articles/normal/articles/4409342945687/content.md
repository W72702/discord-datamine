<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-03210994-7fff-10c3-0635-4ce5d435d771">WHAT IS WATCH TOGETHER?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a id="docs-internal-guid-5bc184e6-7fff-5da8-ea35-12fa0f9c7fff" href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Together</a> is a collaborative way to watch YouTube videos with others. In Watch Together, everyone can participate in building a playlist of videos. Watch Together will handle the video syncing for you - no counting down to pressing play!</span></p>
<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-6a60ad9f-7fff-8316-5009-b462a7356772">HOW TO USE WATCH TOGETHER</h1>
<p>There are many different ways you can launch Watch Together in the Discord app for you and your friends! Whether in a server’s voice channel or in a direct message, you can check out <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activities on Discord</a> for instructions on how to start any Activity.</p>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-0000702c-7fff-036f-ac93-404a0f816764">GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p><span style="color: #4f545c;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Once you've acknowledged YouTube’s user agreements and authorized Watch Together to access your Discord account, you can begin watching videos!</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532804363287" alt="image4.png" width="435" height="521"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532804366359" alt="image3.png" width="417" height="755"></p>
<p>To add videos to the shared playlist, select a trending video, paste a YouTube video link into the search bar, or enter a search term.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532779894551" alt="image1.gif"></p>
<p>As soon as there are videos in the playlist, they will begin autoplaying in order.</p>
<p>Participants in the session can continue adding videos to the playlist throughout the Watch Together session.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H3MK3TZ9HGJB4SQ2R2C73BC7">WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HOSTING OR SHARING?</h2>
<p>By default, the person who started Watch Together is Hosting, and they control what’s playing. In hosting mode, anyone can add videos to the playlist, but only the host can pause, scrub, skip, reorder, and delete any video.</p>
<p>If the host wants others to be able to control the video, they can toggle to Sharing mode. When sharing, all participants have controls over the playlist and the current video, and their actions apply to every user in the session. We recommend Hosting when in big groups and Sharing when in small groups!</p>
<h2 id="h_01H3MK4130BCR8XS4ATP01PGCA">IF I CHANGE THE VOLUME, DOES IT CHANGE EVERYONE ELSE'S VOLUME?</h2>
<p>Volume changes are always local, so if any user adjusts the volume or mutes the YouTube player, only their own audio is affected.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">When using Watch Together on desktop, you can adjust the video volume within the video itself using the volume slider in the video or by adjusting your device’s volume. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15532779896087" alt="ezgif.com-optimize(2).gif"></p>
<p>On mobile, the volume icon in the video window can only mute or unmute the sound. To control the volume, you need to adjust your device’s volume.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H3MMTBMTC0RSGHAARRJRS18X">PLAYBACK</h2>
<p>Playback of videos is limited to 180 minutes if watching with a group or 30 minutes if watching alone. When the max playback limit is reached by an individual user, playback will end for that user. This will start a 10-minute cool-down, after which you can continue watching. This same timer applies no matter what server or voice chat you are in. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the video will continue playing for viewers who have not reached their playback limit. If you are Hosting and hit your playback limit, Watch Together will automatically assign Host to someone who has not reached their playback limit.You do not reclaim Host status when your cooldown timer runs out.</p>
<p>If you do not interact with Watch Together for 30 minutes, your session will be paused until you interact with WT again. If you are Host and you hit your inactivity limit, Watch Together will not reassign host to another user. </p>

<p><strong>Q: If I pause the video, does it pause for everyone else?</strong></p>
<p>A: When the remote is not shared, only the Host can pause the video. When the remote is shared, anyone can pause the video.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I hide the Activity Launcher or remove the activity from my server?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I change this activity to my preferred language?</strong></p>
<p>A: This Activity is currently available only in English, but you can search for videos in different languages within the YouTube player.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can’t I hear the video’s audio?</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">A: Watch Together plays audio through your operating system's audio output device. Your operating system's audio output could be different from your Discord audio output. If you are hearing the voices of other people in a call, but you're not hearing the audio from videos in Watch Together, it means you have set your Discord audio output to a different device than your system audio output.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=""><br></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">To change the audio output for Watch Together, you'll need to change the audio source selected for your operating system. To find and update your operating system's audio output, look for the speakers icon in the Taskbar on Windows, or in System Preferences on a Mac.</span></p>
