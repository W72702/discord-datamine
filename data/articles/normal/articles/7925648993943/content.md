<p><strong>Crisis doesn’t just mean thinking about ending your own life. It’s any painful emotion and anytime you need support.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also surface Crisis Text Line within the Discord mobile app: </span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report a message within the Discord mobile app from iOS or Android by tapping &amp; holding on the message you want to report, then by selecting <strong>‘Report’</strong> in the dropdown menu.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here, you can send resources to a friend to assist them in getting the help they need.</span></p>

<p><strong>International Lifeline Support: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lifeline number is available 24/7 for emotional support (1-800-273-8255). </span></p>

<p><strong>Law Enforcement: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel like another user is in urgent trouble you may consider contacting law enforcement right away and letting them know what's going on, regardless of the information you're able to provide. They generally have more investigative resources and can contact us for information that we aren't able to disclose to others.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Resource Library</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In addition to support via text, </span><a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crisis Text Line provides a resource library</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support people in crisis. These resources include information about how to recognize and cope with various issues, as well as links to additional websites, apps, and tools to support individuals in the moment.</span></em></p>
