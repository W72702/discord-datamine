<h1 id="h_01G69FJQWTWN88HFEHK7Z6X79N">What are Forum Channels?</h1>
<p><span class="discussion-id-f3716217-c974-4257-ba1f-236017cdcc42 discussion-level-1 discussion-id-f3716217-c974-4257-ba1f-236017cdcc42 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">Forum Channels provide a space for organized discussions. With forums, you can discuss specific topics and not worry about talking over each other. Since discussions are contained in posts, it’s easier to jump in on an existing one (or start a new one) without worrying about your message getting buried!</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01G69FKE0ZAX9C65DCGMJGQKFE">How do I create a Forum Channel?</h1>
<p>1. In the channel list, hover over the channel category where you want your <em><strong>Forum Channel</strong></em> to live and hit the <strong>"+"</strong> icon to <strong>Create a Channel</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/6289486804759/3.png" alt="3.png"></p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Forum</strong> as the channel type, and enter a channel name.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: Give your forum channel a clear, specific title that provides guidance on the purpose of the channel.</span></h3>
<p>3. Then click <strong>Create Channel </strong>when you're done!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose between List View and Gallery View as the default layout for your forum channel. Gallery View tends to work better for media-focused forum channels, whereas List View works better for text-based discussions.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Search for a Forum Post</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for a specific discussion in a forum channel? You can search for the post using the forum channel’s dedicated search bar!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, go to your server’s channel list and find the forum channel with the post that you want to search for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in the search bar at the top of the page, input the key word or phase of the post title you’re looking for. The search bar will show results that match with your searched word.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/8871692790039/forum-channel-search-bar.png" alt="forum-channel-search-bar.png"></span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GCYC9WF5871Q5QSXM6VVTFHV"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filtering Posts with Tags</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a forum channel’s posts, specific tags can be associated with certain posts to help organize your forum channel and the numerous different posts under one discussion topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can filter posts in a forum channel by selecting tags. Forum channel posts can have numerous tags, so you can filter posts further by selecting multiple tags.</span></p>

<h1 id="h_01G69FNCKR6XCZKDJKQXC8CYQV">Additional Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Who has access to Forum Channels right now?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Forum Channels are currently available to 100% of Community servers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: When will Forum Channels be available for non-Community servers?</strong></p>
<p>A: Forum Channels are currently only available to Community-enabled servers. If you’re ready to convert your server into a Community server, please check out this<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Help Center article</a> for a detailed guide on how to make the switch.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between Forums and Text channels?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: While Text channels are great for in-the-moment discussions, Forum channels provide a place for more drawn-out discussion around specific topics. Discussions are tied to individual posts so they are more organized and easier for members of your community to get up to speed and join a conversation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between Forums and Threads?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: The main difference is that Forums are a type of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">channel</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while threads are a type of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">message</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While they are similar in that they both create dedicated spaces for organized discussions, Forum Channels are more persistent, while threads are more temporary.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What kind of tools are available to moderate Forum Channels?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To ensure moderation of forum channels is easy and manageable, we’ve implemented 3 types of moderation support:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoMod</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Forum Channels are supported by AutoMod, our built-in moderation tool that helps detect and remove problematic content automatically.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow Mode: If the volume of posts and message activity is concerning, mods can place limits.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">API: We’ve updated our</span><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/threads#forums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> API Documentation</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so developers can integrate support for forums into their products.</span>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a way to close or lock a post in a forum channel?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: If a conversation has reached its end or you need to close it for any reason, you can right click the post and click Close Post. This will cause the post to no longer appear in the new posts section of the list and also lock the post so that only moderators can re-open it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the best way to test forums with my community?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: While all communities are different, we recommend rolling out forums to your community gradually. This way, your community won’t experience big, jarring changes, and they’ll have time to get used to it. One example of a roll-out could look like this:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a private forum for you and your moderators to test and discuss plans</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify existing text channels where forums might be a good fit and replace them</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create new forum channels with the proper guidelines and tags</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an announcement to inform your community about the changes and encourage them to provide feedback</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your community’s feedback is largely positive, identify larger “core” text channels that could benefit from the organization forums bring</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: How many posts can be pinned to the top? How long do they stay pinned?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Forum channels currently only support having one pinned post. Pinned posts aren’t on a timer, so they will remain pinned until it’s unpinned or another post is pinned (replacing the original pinned post).</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you add or replace a thumbnail to a post?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: If you forgot to add a thumbnail to your original post, you can do so by being the first to reply to your original post with a photo. When you do this, the option to add the media to the original post will appear. If you select </span><strong>Add to Post</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it will append your media to the original post and act as the thumbnail.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I ping people within a forum channel? Will they be notified when a new thread is created with a ping in it?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes, you can ping people in a forum channel. They'll be able to continue receiving notifications if they're following that specific forum post! That is not the case for the forum channel as a whole. They won't be pinged for every new thread. Mentions in forum posts work in the same way as threads, which you can read more about in the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4403205878423#h_01F99ZCPB03MNQYYMHDFWQWR1E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threads FAQ</a>.</span></p>
