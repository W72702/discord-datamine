<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shower your friends in love using <strong>Discord Game Gifting</strong>! Gift games entirely through the Discord app &amp; send to your friends via text channels.</span></p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchasing gifts</span></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start your journey to become the world’s best gift-giver at a game’s store page. Select “<strong>Buy as gift</strong>” underneath the buy button, can’t miss it. <br></span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040797672/1.png" alt="1.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A prompt will pop up to select a payment method. This will look familiar to the regular process of buying yourself a game. Be sure to have the “<strong>Is this a gift purchase</strong>?” checked.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040811251/2.png" alt="2.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the purchase is complete a gift link will pop up which you’ll be sending to that special someone!</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040811311/3.png" alt="3.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing this link with another user will allow them to claim this gift. BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PUT THIS LINK! <strong>Once a game has been claimed you won’t be able to unclaim this gift.</strong> If you toss this link into a server there will be a mad dash to claim this gift. The person that claims this gift will have this game FOREVERRRR.</span></p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our support team is <strong>unable to issue a refund for a claimed gift</strong>. Our standard <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy" target="_self">refund policy</a> applies, but only for an unclaimed gift.</span></h3>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing your gifts</span></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage all pending gifts, navigate to the Library &gt; Inventory. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040811371/4.png" alt="4.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here you’ll be able to revoke a gift link in the case you accidentally sent it to the wrong person. Simply click <strong>Revoke</strong>. The previously sent gift link is now useless! </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040797752/5.png" alt="5.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve revoked a link, or the link expires naturally, you’ll be able to generate a new gift link.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040797772/6.png" alt="6.png"></p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: all gift links will automatically expire after two days. Simply navigate back to your Inventory to generate a new link. </span></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending this link in a text channel will allow a user to claim this gift. Simply clicking <strong>Accept</strong> will claim the gift! The game has now been added to the Library where they’ll be able to install &amp; launch.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360040811391/7.png" alt="7.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having last minute regrets &amp; think the game would be happier in your library instead? No problem! You can also click <strong>Accept</strong> to send yourself a gift! Once a gift has been claimed, by either someone else or yourself, the gift will no longer appear in the Gift Inventory. <br><br>That’s pretty much it! Sit back &amp; relax as your friends give you thanks in the form of endless heart emojis!</span></p>
