<p>Our team has received reports regarding output audio issues in voice calls on the Macbook Discord client. Specifically, audio coming from the left side of the Macbook is very faint. <br><br>We would like to clarify that this behavior is by design to reduce echos going into the mic. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/macbook-air/take-a-tour-apd7e765329d/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MacBooks have their microphone under the left speaker</a>. </p>
