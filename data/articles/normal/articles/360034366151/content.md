<p>Ever had trouble connecting to Discord or seeing content in your favorite chats? One of the most common issues coming between you and your friends' cat pics is your <strong>domain name service provider</strong>. The domain name service, or DNS provider, is the service your computer uses to translate the text and code delivered by webpages into sweet and tasty internet content goodness.</p>
<h1>Why Change DNS Providers?</h1>
<p>Swapping your provider can make for a faster and more reliable web experience, and can often even improve your privacy, too! Changing your DNS provider is also one of the first solutions we recommend if you're encountering one of the following common service issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Degraded voice quality</li>
    <li>Images not loading</li>
    <li>Stuck in an update loop</li>
    <li>Unable to download Discord</li>
    <li>Can't connect to voice chat</li>
</ul>
<h1>Which Should I Use?</h1>
<p>Here at Discord, we typically recommend <strong>Google Public DNS </strong>and <strong>Cloudflare 1.1.1.1</strong>. Both Google and Cloudflare are trusted and dependable service providers whose servers we rely on for hosting Discord! We recommend these options because they deliver the most consistent and speedy access to text chat, images, videos, and even voice chat!<br><br><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using" target="_self"><strong>Google Public DNS</strong></a> is easy to use on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can even work on your mobile device's wifi connection if you're willing to mess with some device settings!<br><br><a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/" target="_self"><strong>Cloudflare 1.1.1.1</strong></a> works on computers just as well as Google Public DNS, but for users on mobile devices running Android and iOS, they offer a mobile app that lets you use their service as a replacement DNS provider for while you're on cellular data and not just wifi!</p>
<p>The steps for changing your provider look different based on your platform, and the IP addresses can change over time, so we always recommend checking out the websites linked above first. That said, you can find some simple walkthroughs for various platforms below!</p>
