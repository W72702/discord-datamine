<p>Discord has 5 <strong>status icons</strong> that are pretty simple representations of user status. They are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Green = Online</p>

<p>Yellow = Idle</p>

<p>Red = Do Not Disturb</p>

<p>Purple = Streaming</p>

<p>Gray = Invisible/Offline</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you only get put into idle status when you've been away from your device for a while- similar to being moved to an AFK (away from keyboard) voice channel. And while Offline doesn't have a dot, you'll see the user's name and avatar grayed out pretty thoroughly.</p>
