<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17565739061783" alt="activity_alerts_banner1.png"></p>
<p>An Activity Alert is an alert that will appear as a banner (if you’re online) at the top of your Discord to warn you of any possible unusual/heightened activity that is happening in your server. If you’re offline, you’ll get a push notification. AutoMod will also send a message in your designated alert channel letting you know of the unusual activity. This allows admins and moderators to take quick action in dealing with any unusual activity.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17565747207319" alt="security_actions.png"></p>
<p>Security Actions can be used to secure your server in the event of an incident. This allows you to not only pause invites, but also pause DM’s between non-friends that are members within the server.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HAD80CK6B6W8NCDBPV1JEF2P">How to use Activity Alerts</h1>
<p>In the event of unusual activity in your server, you'll see a banner appear at the top of your Discord app (both on desktop and mobile) if you’re currently online, notifying you of this unusual activity. If you’re offline, you’ll receive a push notification instead. AutoMod will also post a message in your designated alert channel letting you know of any unusual activity as well.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17565747216919" alt="activity_alerts_banner2.png"></p>
<p>If this notification appears while you’re in the server in question, you can tap on <a href="#h_01HAD80CK67WF59GDGR7XGVAN8"><strong>Security Actions</strong></a> to pause Invites or DMs while you investigate.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17565747230359" alt="activity_alerts_banner3.png"></p>
<p>If you’re currently viewing another server when the alert comes in, tapping on <strong>Review the Alert</strong> will bring you to the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/15946797617431"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Members Page</span></a> for that server.</p>
<p>If you notice unusual behavior, you can use <a href="#h_01HAD80CK67WF59GDGR7XGVAN8"><strong>Security Actions</strong></a> to pause Invites or DMs while you investigate.</p>

<p>5. If you want to end these Security Actions early, you can go back into the <strong>Security Actions settings</strong> and disable the <strong>Pause Invites</strong> and <strong>Pause DMs</strong>. Once you’re finished, tap on <strong>Save </strong>to remove the pause.</p>
<p>6. Finally, you’ll be able to mark the alert as <strong>Mark as Resolved </strong>once it’s been handled and leave a note for other moderators as to how.</p>
