You can set a temporary invite link that only lasts 30 minutes, or one that doesn’t expire at all, if you are in a Community Server. Want to set a Custom Invite Link?

<p>The invite panel will appear displaying a 7 days access link by default if you haven't already adjusted the invite settings for that channel yet. Otherwise, the invite that displays will be dictated by your previous settings for that specific channel.  </p>
<p>By clicking on <strong>Edit Invite Link</strong>, you’ll have the ability to change the duration of the link as well as how many times it can be accessed.   </p>

<h3><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Starting on June 8, 2023, invite links created in Friend Servers (servers that don't have Community enabled) can last anywhere from 30 min to 30 days. To create invite links that never expire, servers will need to be a Community Server. You can continue to generate non-expiring links if you are in a Community Server.</span></h3>
<p>Once you’re in the Create Invite panel you can edit the invite settings by tapping on <strong>Edit invite link</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 480px; width: 463px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15156541577367"></p>
<p>Here you can change how long the invite link will be valid for and how many times this invite link can be used for.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 305px; width: 310px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15156564355863"><img style="height: 308px; width: 270px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15156535233175"></p>
<p>After editing the settings you can simply copy the invite link and directly send it to your friends or by tapping on the Invite button next to their name. </p>

<p>Enabling <strong>Grant temporary membership</strong> means that members who join through the invite link are automatically kicked when they disconnect unless a role is assigned.</p>

<p>If you want the invite link to never expire, make sure you are in a Community Server before setting <strong>Expire After</strong> to <strong>Never</strong>. The maximum duration for Friends Servers is 30 days. </p>
<p>If you want the invite link to have infinite uses, you can set Max number of uses to <strong>No limit</strong>. It's important to remember that the only way anyone can access your server is through an invite link so be careful with who you give it to!</p>
<p>Once you’ve adjusted the settings to your needs, tap on <strong>Generate a New Link</strong> and your new invite link will appear. </p>
