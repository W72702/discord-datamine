<p>Do you ever run into the problem of trying to stay focused when using Discord?</p>
<p>We've implemented notifications muting! Muting a channel or a server prevents unread indicators and notifications from appearing <em>unless you are mentioned</em> (which includes the <strong>@everyone</strong> and <strong>@here</strong> tags). </p>
<h1>Discord used mute!</h1>
<p>There are two categories of muting notifications, <strong>channel</strong> <strong>mutes </strong>and<strong> <strong>server-wide</strong> mutes. </strong>They're super effective. </p>
<h2>
    <strong>1.</strong> Channel Mute:
</h2>
<p>If you don't need to blackout your entire server chat, but rather, just silence a couple that are blowing up your notifications, there are a few different ways to mute them.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-large">Single Channel Mute</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058113732/Capture62.jpg" alt="Capture62.jpg"></p>
<p>If you only have <strong>one channel</strong> that you'd like to mute, toggle that channel and <strong>click the bell icon</strong> in the upper right-hand corner. When muted, the icon will update.</p>
<h3><em>Note: Clicking the bell doesn't mean all your other channels are muted, just this one. You'll either need to click the bell in each channel to mute them, or use the multi-channel mute screen. Check that out below.</em></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-large">Multiple Channel Mute</span></p>
<p>In order to <strong>mute</strong> <strong>multiple channels</strong> within a single server at once, click on the arrow next to the Server Name to pull up the Server menu. </p>
<p>Then click <strong>Notification Settings </strong>from the drop-down menu that appears.</p>

<p>Under Notification Overrides you'll be able to control the specific channels you don't want to hear from!</p>
<h2>
    <strong>2. </strong>Server Mute:
</h2>
<p>Incase you want to go the easy route, open up the same <strong>Notification Settings</strong> panel from the above step (click on your Server Name, then select Notification Settings in the drop down menu) and <strong>enable</strong> the first option, <strong>Mute [Server Name]</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360058113932/Capture.JPG" alt="Capture.JPG"></p>
<p>You can also mute an entire server by <strong>right-clicking </strong>on the server icon in your server list, and selecting <strong>Mute Server</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>

<h3>Remember muting a server is not immune to notifications pertaining to you personally, such as <strong>@username</strong>, <strong>@role</strong>, <strong>@everyone</strong>, or <strong>@here</strong>.</h3>
<p>You won't receive the unread dots next to channel names or servers, but if you are mentioned specifically you will get the red indicators showing you how many times you were mentioned in which servers. </p>
