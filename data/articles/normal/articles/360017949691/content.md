<h1 id="h_01ESPA65Z06QW1ANR3M8WK1NPS"><strong>What if I'm Currently a Legacy Nitro Yearly Subscriber?Â </strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>January 1st, 2021</strong></span>, legacy yearly Nitro plans will be returned back to Nitro Classic plans.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can continue to pay the same $49.99 annually, and your Nitro perks will change from $99.99/year Nitro Perks to Nitro Classic perks.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, that means you'll no longer have access to 2 included Boosts, Go Live stream capability will change from Source to 1080p 60fps, and upload size will change from 100MB to 50MB.</span></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:Â </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have active Boosts from your legacy plan, these will deactivate after a three day grace period. As a Classic subscriber you'll continue to get 30% off any Boosts you purchase.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Early Supporter badge will stay, that's yours forever :)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, we genuinely appreciate the support youâ€™ve given us over the years, and we're always thinking of new ways to add to Nitro and Server Boosting. If you have any suggestions for Nitro, </span><a href="https://feedback.discord.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">please let us know here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
