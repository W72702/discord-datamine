<p>Communities are an essential part of Discord, and we’re making it a core responsibility for us to serve communities and create first-class experiences for both administrators and members.</p>
<p>If you run a community, you can now designate your server as a <strong>Community Server</strong> inside Server Settings and get access to some powerful tools to help you run, moderate, and grow your server! </p>

<p>In order to enable <strong>Community</strong> for your Discord server, you are required to have the following settings enabled in order to ensure safety in the community:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Safety Checks </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Verification Level Setting</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members of the server must have a verified email on their Discord account before sending messages or DMing anyone in the server. (Note that this doesn’t apply to users that have been assigned roles!)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Explicit Media Content Filter </strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Scan media content from all members: this will scan all media sent in the server and delete any content that contains potential explicit content. Our policy requires users to apply an age-restricted label to any channels that contain explicit content. <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Learn more about how to do this here</span></a>!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rules or Guidelines Channel </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>There must be a clearly posted server rules channel for members. This is useful so that new members understand what is cool and not cool in your community!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Community Updates/Moderators Channel </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the channel where Discord will send announcements and updates relevant to Community Server admins and moderators, like new moderation features.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lastly, all <strong>servers must comply with our </strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Community Guidelines</span></strong></a>. We want to make sure that users joining your server have a good experience and that there’s nothing that violates our Guidelines on your server.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Set up a personalized welcome screen for new visitors so they know what your community is about and where to start. This way, they can immediately head to the welcome and rules channels instead of wandering around the server.</li>

        <strong>Direct Community Updates from Discord: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>New features and changes from Discord can significantly impact your server. To help keep up to date, you can now select a moderator-only channel for official Discord updates. We’ll give you that heads up so you and your moderation team can always be prepared.</li>
