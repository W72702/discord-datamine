<h1>WHAT IS THE NOTIFICATION BOT?</h1>
<p>The Notification Bot is a bot we've developed for Activities that can be played by people who are not online at the same time. It sends a direct message to players who are in a shared game of Checkers in the Park or Chess in the Park when it’s their time to make a move (and one of the players isn’t in the Activity).</p>
<h1>CAN I ADD THE NOTIFICATION BOT TO MY SERVER?</h1>
<p>The Notification Bot is currently only available and active on the Discord Games Lab server.</p>
<h1>HOW DO I OPT OUT OF THE NOTIFICATION BOT?</h1>
<p>If you’d prefer not to receive notifications from your game, you can mute or block messages from the Notification Bot like any other DM:</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also turn off this setting for the Discord Games Lab server entirely by going to Settings Dropdown &gt; Privacy Settings and toggling “Allow direct messages from server members” to off. Note that doing so will prevent direct messages from other Discord Games Lab server members as well.</span></p>

<h2><strong>DISCORD GAMES LAB SERVER FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackbox</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
