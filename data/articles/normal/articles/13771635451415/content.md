Nitro Basic subscribers and users on a Nitro trial subscribers are not eligible to share Nitro trials.</span></h3>
<p>As a Nitro subscriber, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open a direct message (DM) with the person you want to share a Nitro trial with on a desktop device. <strong>This cannot be in a group DM.</strong></p>
<p>2. Head to your chatbox and press the new Nitro icon to proceed with sharing a trial. <br><strong>This icon will only appear if the recipient is eligible to receive a trial from you.</strong></p>

<p>3. The recipient will see a confirmation message letting them know they can redeem your gifted trial. Like all free trials we offer, a payment method must be entered by the recipient to redeem and begin the trial. </p>

<h3><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Note: You can share a total of 3 Nitro trials with others. A trial expires if not redeemed by the recipient in 48 hours, but you’ll get refunded the trial back. You have until June 15th to share your trials, so share them soon to spread the fun!</span></h3>
<h1>WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A NITRO TRIAL FROM ME?</h1>
<p>Users who have not had an active Nitro subscription on their Discord accounts in the past 12 months are eligible to receive a trial from you.</p>
<p>So if you do not see your ‘share a Nitro trial’ icon, it means the person you’re trying to share a trial with is ineligible for one of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They already have Nitro</li>
    <li>They’ve already received or redeemed a Nitro trial in the last 12 months</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01GXSDNDTW825Y61T4BYSC81CB">RECEIVING A NITRO TRIAL FROM SOMEONE</h1>
