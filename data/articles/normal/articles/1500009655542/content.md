<h2 id="h_01GRYW20YR3GAYSZKQ608GTAQH">What Is The Poker Shop?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest update in February 2023 we replaced the Gift Tokens feature with a new in-game Poker Shop where you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim free content packs or purchase content packs to customize your gameplay with stickers, card backs, dealer skins, and themes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll use real currency to purchase anything in the Poker Shop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12336463513879" alt="update-poker-night-poker-shop.png" width="510" height="466"></span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GRYW28FMQB3QEPZRCT3GM8H2" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are Content Packs?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content Packs are bundles of in-game cosmetic content with a theme. For example, the Lucky Stars Content Pack has dealer skins, stickers, and card backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Content Packs will be free to claim while others require purchasing with real currency.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12336463625879" alt="updated-poker-night-activity-example.png"></span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GRYW2F4CT3GQ8E76DN09KG9F" class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Showdown Mode?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Showdown Mode players must buy in using funds from their chip reserve. When leaving the game, winnings are deposited into the player's chip reserve. The chip reserve is used to rank players in the same server on the Showdown Leaderboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winner of the previous Showdown Leaderboard Season gains the crown to be worn for the duration of the current Season.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: In an update in February 2023, levels were reset and are no longer associated with Showdown Mode rankings. The level is now tied to the user, and will be displayed at all times as a number next to their player avatar.</span></h3>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play League but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>
