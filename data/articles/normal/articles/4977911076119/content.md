<h1 id="h_01FYWWNGTFY94TKW46M75TEHF5"><strong>WHAT IS LAND-IO?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land-io</a>, players claim territory by moving around, making trails, and enclosing plots of land to gain them as their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to have the most land claimed when game time runs out, but watch out for other players! If someone runs into your trail, you'll lose all the land you've collected."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The player with the most land at the end of the 5 minutes wins the game.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use our platform to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackbox</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: There is no age requirement for Land-io. By playing Land-io you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country, as required by our </span><a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p>A: Public game may include players from outside of your servers. By default your username and avatar will be anonymized, assigning a character image and name to display in game. </p>
<p>Switching to a Private game will only include the players from inside the same Server and voice call that you are playing in.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Can you use voice and video with players in a public game of Land-io?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: You can only use voice, video, or text chat with those inside your same server and voice call, regardless of being in a public or private game of Land-io.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How does player anonymization work in Land-io?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: Turning on anonymization in Public game mode assigns a character image and name to display in game instead of your username and avatar.</p>
<p>You can choose to turn off anonymization to show username and avatar to all players in the game (including those outside your server that are in the game.)</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, " and then select "Land-io"</span></p>
