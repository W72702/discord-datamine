<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-05f2f6d6-7fff-7b6f-7015-1c6f6719d40f">What is Clyde?</h1>
<p>Clyde is Discord’s AI chat integration for your server, which uses OpenAI technology, and is ready to hang out with you and your friends. Clyde is an experimental feature and currently free to try out as soon as it is available in your server. With Clyde, you can:<br>1. Discover new things (knowledge, tips, and jokes)</p>
<p>2. Play interactive games (trivia)</p>
<p>3. Get recommendations (movies, books, local restaurants)</p>
<p>4. Express yourself (GIFs, memes, and emojis)</p>
<p>To ensure that you are chatting with the official Discord Clyde chatbot, make sure that the username and @ mentions refer to “Clyde” with a capital “C” (as in the screenshot below).</p>

<p>Server Admins will see a channel notice informing them that Clyde is coming to their server. <span id="docs-internal-guid-0596d99b-7fff-7f93-bf8a-6b6088c95560">Once Clyde is enabled, Server Admins can customize Clyde access permissions based on role. Go to </span><strong>Guild Setting &gt; Roles &gt; Permissions</strong> to manage Clyde access:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/16678689938583" alt="image7.png"></p>
<p>Server Members will see a channel notice informing them that Clyde is enabled in their server. Once they receive this notice, Members can immediately begin <a href="#docs-internal-guid-d333d1c6-7fff-ca46-f4b6-8427ea6aa8b9" target="_self" rel="undefined">Chatting with Clyde.</a></p>

<p>Server Admins may also customize Clyde’s personality for their server by providing a backstory. To do this, go to <strong>Clyde’s avatar &gt; View Profile &gt; Edit Clyde</strong>. If an Admin has created a custom Clyde personality, members will see a pencil icon next to Clyde’s AI tag and can message Clyde to ask for its backstory. Admins should ensure their customized backstory is consistent with Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Community Guidelines</span></a>. Members can reach out to their Server Admin if there are any questions or concerns with Clyde’s custom personality or responses.</p>
<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-d333d1c6-7fff-ca46-f4b6-8427ea6aa8b9">Chatting with Clyde</h1>
<p>Members can begin chatting with Clyde in any text channel in servers where Clyde is enabled. To get started, all you need to do is<strong> mention @Clyde somewhere in your message or reply to an existing Clyde message.</strong> When you first chat with Clyde, you will see an ephemeral message with details about Clyde and how to use it. If you’re in a server with Clyde, you can also direct message with Clyde and Clyde may also be available in group messages you’re in for you and your friends to invoke.</p>

<p>You can chat with Clyde by sending it questions or other prompts, and Clyde will generate a response using knowledge it has of the server, its members, and recent chat history. In some instances to help it generate a more relevant or current response, Clyde may also conduct a web search using search terms it generates based on your message to it.</p>
<p>You can ask Clyde things like, “Recommend a playlist that’s good for late nights” or “Send a GIF to get everyone pumped up.”</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-d70e3374-7fff-54ae-8245-f20fe41f597a">Clyde is currently able to chat in the following places:</p>
<p>1. In <strong>text channels</strong>,<strong> text in voice</strong>, or <strong>user-created threads</strong>, Clyde can read and reply to messages that mention @Clyde or <strong>reply</strong> to Clyde to keep the conversation flowing. For context to help it generate a more relevant response, Clyde can also read recent messages sent in the <strong>text channel</strong>,<strong> text in voice</strong>, or <strong>user-created thread </strong>prior to the message that invoked it.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HA2HT0198QYE5P099JCX8S5X"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Clyde may proactively respond to the person who originally pinged him for up to 10 messages after being mentioned.</span></h3>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4d7714af-7fff-f993-16c6-145b377de219">2. In any </span><strong>thread </strong>that Clyde starts for a user, Clyde can read all messages in that thread and reply to those it determines are directed at it.

If you are a member of a server where Clyde is available, you can direct message with Clyde: (1) By going to Clyde’s profile and pressing <strong>Message Clyde</strong> or (2) In some cases, Clyde may DM you first. After you first message Clyde in a server, Clyde may DM you to introduce and provide additional information about itself. If you see a proactive message from Clyde in your DM list, that’s why.  </p>

<p>4. If you are a member of a server where Clyde is available, Clyde may also be available in group messages you’re in. Clyde can read and reply to messages that mention @Clyde or <strong>reply</strong> to Clyde to help keep the conversation flowing between you and your friends. To help Clyde generate a more relevant response, Clyde can also read recent messages sent in the group message prior to the message that invoked it. <strong>Clyde only reads messages in a group message when invoked.</strong></p>

<p>Even with safeguards in place, Clyde is experimental and might respond with content or other information that could be considered biased, misleading, harmful, or inaccurate. To help, Clyde will respect AutoMod rules set up by Admins for their servers. If Clyde believes a response would violate a rule set for AutoMod in a server, Clyde will instead respond to the user’s prompt with a general message indicating it cannot reply to that prompt.</p>
<p>As with all AI, be mindful of what you share with Clyde and how you use it. Don’t tell Clyde information that you don’t have the right to share, or rely on Clyde for advice, Discord tech support, or safety issues. Clyde cannot be used to report abuse or take action against other users. As with other Discord features, remember to follow our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a> when interacting with Clyde (including with respect to the messages you send and the responses generated by Clyde).

In addition, Clyde may also be available in group messages you’re in for you and your friends to invoke by mentioning @Clyde or replying to a Clyde message.<span id="docs-internal-guid-6bb1f928-7fff-5103-7ab9-74bf0db25195"></span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I add Clyde to my server?</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-6d7e1e1e-7fff-7555-8306-a6985c39df0e">A:</span> Unlike bots, Clyde is not available for Admins to add to servers—in fact, we’re building it into Discord! For now, we have selected a small, random sample of servers to test Clyde out and make improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is Discord using OpenAI technology for Clyde?</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-265e00c3-7fff-96a7-e2a0-1d453d2b1ffd">A: We are experimenting with Clyde using OpenAI technology today, however this may change or expand to include or use other AI models in the future.</span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-cd7408fb-7fff-9897-4291-f23a330544ce"><strong>Q: Why is Clyde giving me strange responses?</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-86fb98eb-7fff-b6e4-a6bc-b7892df582db">A: Clyde is experimental and not perfect so you might come across information that could be considered biased, misleading, harmful or inaccurate, even with safeguards in place. Clyde may also not have information, or be able to respond to every prompt. Clyde’s answers are generated based on the user’s prompt to it and the data sources fueling the OpenAI technology, <span id="docs-internal-guid-e7c84822-7fff-e371-df40-2744507a8431">and web searches it’s able to conduct using search terms it generates based on the prompt. </span>. Accordingly, Clyde may also have limited or outdated knowledge of the world and events, and it also has limited context when it comes to the specifics of your server. </span></p>

<p><strong>Q: How can I moderate Clyde?</strong></p>
