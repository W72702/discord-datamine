<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What is a Server Web Page?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Server Web Page is a web page that a Discord server owner can set up to attract, educate, and engage new community members. New community members will be able to join the server directly from this web page. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Which servers can create a Server Web Page? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, web pages are available to a small set of </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery#:~:text=Searching%20for%20New%20Communities,-If%20you%20know&amp;text=Once%20you've%20typed%20in,begin%20exploring%20servers%20from%20there!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discoverable servers</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>How do I set up a web page? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are eligible for a web page, you can set one up by going to Server Settings, and then to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server Web Pages in the Commu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nity section. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have filled in your content, click “Publish Page” to submit your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> web page content. Once the page is live, click on “View Page” to view your web page. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What content should I add to my web page? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All web page content needs to abide by Discord’s </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409308485271-Discovery-Guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discovery Guidelines</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Discord’s Trust and Safety team will remove web pages that violate these guidelines, and consider whether further action is necessary.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help people find your server: When adding content to your web page, use words that describe your community accurately and specifically. This will help new community members easily find your server when they’re searching the web for relevant terms. If your server is for underwater basket weaving enthusiasts, use these words rather than more generic ones. Your next basket weaver may be just one search term away!  </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>How do I make updates to my web page?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates can be made to your web by going to Server Settings, and then t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o Server Web Pages in the Community section.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>How do I take down my web page? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can opt-out of having a web page any time by going to yo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ur Server Web Pages settin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gs and clicking “Disable Web Page”. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Does my server need a specific server boost level to access this feature?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server web pages are currently in beta and are available to all servers that have access to the beta, regardless of Boost Level. In the future, we may integrate page features that require a certain Boost Level. </span></p>
