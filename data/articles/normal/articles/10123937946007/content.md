<h1 id="h_01H4RGTAJV5YNE3SC3N08TQ1WC">What are Age-Restricted Commands?</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Age-restricted commands are </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commands from apps</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> that may contain age-restricted content, and may only be used by people 18 or older. To ensure that Discord is safe for everyone, our policies require that developers label adult content as age-restricted and not distribute it to people under the age of 18.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01H4RGTEVTR5J9WNW76GXSHHG9">Who can use Age-Restricted Commands?</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Users who are 18 and older can access them in servers and DMs.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01H4RGTK8RJ9CBHZNEKHTZ8FKR">Where can they be used?</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">They can be used within </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age-restricted channels</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> in servers, and in DMs after a user has opted-in to use them.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01H4RGTQD3JJFZG5PY4999360F">How do I access Age-Restricted Commands?</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">In servers, you can use these commands only within </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age-restricted channels</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">. Not all apps have age-restricted commands, but if an app in your server has them, they’ll only be accessible within those designated channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">In DMs, age-restricted commands are turned off by default. If an app contains age-restricted commands, you can access them by enabling the toggle within User Settings &gt; Privacy&gt; Server Privacy Defaults.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01H4RGTZFBRYQNBBJ181E1ZG8T">Help! I’m over 18 years old, but can’t use Age-Restricted commands!</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If you are over the age of 18 and have been locked out of an age-restricted channel, or are unable to use age-restricted commands in DMs, you can appeal by following the instructions below. </span></p>
<h2 id="h_01H4RGV3GHY1HTTFA2T5TW4QH4">What does Discord need to submit an appeal?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Step 1: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Take a photo of yourself that includes yourself holding the following items:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">A photo ID that contains your date of birth</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">A piece of paper that shows your full Discord Username</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Step 2: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Once you have taken the photo, submit a request to the Trust &amp; Safety team here: </span><a href="https://dis.gd/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dis.gd/request</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> and select “Appeals, age update, other questions” and then "Update my age information".</span></p>
