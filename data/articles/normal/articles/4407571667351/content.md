<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOW TO IDENTIFY USERS: </span></h1>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-35f34a41-7fff-6340-7587-1fc64b3b50a1" style="color: #434343;">Usernames are changing on Discord. New usernames are lowercase, alphanumeric, limited to certain special characters, and </span><strong><span style="color: #434343;">do not have discriminators.</span></strong><span style="color: #434343;"> During the transition from old usernames to new usernames, some users will still have old usernames with discriminators (#0000) while other users will have new usernames. For more information see our Help Center article </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/12620128861463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><span style="color: #434343;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure Discord’s prompt compliance with the legal process, the user information provided needs to uniquely identify a Discord account. We can locate users in our system by user identification number, username, and email. The user identification number is the most preferred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to include requisite information will result in Discord’s inability to comply with the legal process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IP addresses, usernames (without the discriminator), and server nicknames can be helpful to support any of the above, however, they are insufficient to uniquely identify an account as they can be shared by multiple Discord accounts. </span></p>
<p><strong>HOW TO FIND USER ID:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Discord user is assigned a 17 or 18 digit user identification number (UID). UID’s are unique to each user and cannot be changed. </span></p>
<p><strong>OBTAINING THE USER ID: DESKTOP APP</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Enable Developer Mode</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll find Developer Mode in User Settings &gt; Advanced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Right-click user and select ‘Copy ID’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will copy the 17 or 18 digit UID to your clipboard.<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4407564270487/2.png" alt="2.png"></span></p>
<h1><strong>OBTAINING THE USER ID: MOBILE APP</strong></h1>

<h1><strong>HOW TO FIND USERNAMES AND DISCRIMINATORS:</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Discord user has a unique case-sensitive username which includes a four-digit discriminator (UserName#1234). Usernames, including discriminators, can be changed by users. Discord also changes usernames once an account is deleted. Provide the username if the UID is unavailable. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">OBTAINING THE USERNAME: DESKTOP APP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Right-click and select ‘View Profile’ or ‘Profile’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profile will show the user’s username, including the discriminator, as depicted below</span></p>
