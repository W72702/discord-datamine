<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll want to use this method if you </span><strong>find yourself in the situation of being unable to log into your Discord account</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; uninstall conventional way. If you didn't select a custom location when you installed the game, the default install location of these Discord games is located on your PC under: </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Users &gt; (Profile) &gt; AppData &gt; Local &gt; DiscordGames</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading into this folder you’ll see a list of games that you have installed.

<p>If you used a custom install location instead of the default, head to your custom install location and delete the game from there instead! </p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Currently, this method of uninstalling your games won't remove their entries from Windows's <strong>Apps &amp; features </strong>list (also called <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> on Windows 7)</p>
