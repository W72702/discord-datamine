<h1 id="h_01GK285ENTCX37J9PYCM1ADXCH"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up your Connections &amp; Connection Details</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to find a tab in your </span><strong>User Settings</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> labeled </span><strong>Connections.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This tab will allow you to add, remove, and manage all of your connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some connections have </span><strong>Connection details, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">for example: Steam. We will be adding Connection details for more Connections moving forward as we gather user feedback. Once connected, you can learn which have connection details from the Connections tab in your user settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have Connections setup for these accounts, you will need to re-connect the account in order for Discord to get </span><strong>Connection details. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can re-connect by going through the “Add accounts to your profile” flow at the top. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add a new Connection with </span><strong>Connection details </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">by going through the same “Add accounts to your profile” flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want these </span><strong>Connection details </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to display publicly on your profile, you can toggle “Display details on profile”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have verified your accounts, you will be able to view your </span><strong>Connection details</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your profile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also view </span><strong>Connection details </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">on other users’ profiles if they’ve set them up.</span></p>

</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to view a shortened list of <strong>Connection details </strong>on users’ profile popouts (profile popout can be reached by clicking a user’s name or icon from chat). If this is a channel with a <strong>Linked Role, </strong>you will see the connections that are relevant to the role. For example, if the Steam Gamer linked role requires the Steam connection to access, it will be shown in the Linked Roles modal. Once you’ve connected to your Steam account, and been granted the Steam Gamer linked role, you will be notified of the channels/spaces you now have access to within the server. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some servers may have channels gated with a Linked Role. Admins may require certain </span><strong>Connection details </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in order to get that role - for example, a Twitter account older than 10 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to gain the role and therefore access to the channel, you will need to verify your </span><strong>Connection details. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so, you can go to the </span><strong>Server menu dropdown &gt; Linked Roles.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are in a Linked Roles’-gated channel, you will see a tag next to your username that  lets other members know that you have the role. This is called the Linked Role Tag.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can click on the tag to view what checks the admins require on users’ </span>Connection details<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to enter the Connections-gated channel.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we’ve extended connection capabilities to apps (beyond the ones you see in </span><strong>User Settings &gt; Connections</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Admins can add apps to their server with these capabilities and may decide that you need to connect with them to be granted a particular linked role in the server. Developers can add connection capabilities for their own apps.

<h1 id="h_01GDGVPDF6A30EYFSRCN8E130G"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-x-large">Frequently Asked Questions</span></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q: How many third party accounts can I connect to my Discord account?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can connect as many third party accounts as you want.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: There’s an account connection I want to have, but the connection isn’t available as an option. Can I create my own connection / app with connection capabilities?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes, we opened up </span><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an API for all developers</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build any app with connection capabilities. With your new app with connection capabilities, you can talk to your server admins to create a Linked Role based on it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I lose my access to a Linked Role-gated channel if I remove the connected account?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: What kind of information does Discord collect when I connect my accounts?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: This varies depending on the account. When you go through the connection flow, you will see a modal which lists what information Discord is collecting from the account. This will be stored securely within our databases, and will never be shared externally with third-parties without your explicit permission.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does removing the account from Connections revoke Discord’s access to my information?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes. This revokes Discord’s access to the account moving forward, AND permanently deletes any information that we collected from our records.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Connections information carry over across different accounts if I use Account Switcher?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: No. You need to re-add the Connection to a different account if you switch accounts.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GDGVN87CN32ANR55V4DF0972"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Scam Protection</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: How can you tell if another user with Connections visible on their profile card is not a fake account?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do a few things to prevent fake accounts from using Connections to falsely verify themselves:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Connection can only be added to other Discord accounts after a certain period of time. This prevents bad actors from using one social media account to verify a bunch of fake profiles.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord account details (account age, age in server) are now available to user profiles alongside the new Connection details. You can use these details to make your own determination about whether this is an account that the user is invested in, or if the account is fake.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding Connections helps verify your account further. In order to add a Connection, you have to have the correct login and authenticate through any security protocols on the third party website.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01GDGVNGJTQKGKEQPPKMM94T4D"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Profile Visibility</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: Who can view Connection details on my profile?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any user can view Connection details in your profile if you’ve selected to display them on your profile </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(from the Connections tab in User Settings).</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Which 3rd party App Connections are available today?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Jefit, Bloxlink, Solana, DeviantArt, Charlemagne, Captcha.bot</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I see what my profile card looks like in a community server that I’m a member of?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view your profile from anywhere in a server (you can click your icon in a channel or by clicking your username in the member list to the right).</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Connection visibility change depending on which server I am participating in?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can see your Connections on all servers. However, Connection </span><strong>details </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">are only visible in the beta servers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I change the visibility of my Connections?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: In your Connections user settings, select the Connection you want to modify and toggle off “display details on profile”. Other members of the server will still be able to see that you are verified with that Connection, but your personal information associated with that Connection will not be visible. You can also hide the connection completely by toggling off “display on profile”.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GDGVNQPH82F6Q10F6QACG6TE"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Setting up Connections</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need Nitro to have Connection details?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, your Nitro status does not impact your ability to add Connections or Connection details. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: I’ve added a payment provider account to Connections, but why am I still not being verified?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to your other payment provider account and confirm that you have a valid bank account on file as a form of payment. Having just a credit card or debit card on file will not qualify you for the “verified” status.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: I’m eligible for a role in my server, but I still don’t have access - how do I get access?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: If you have an eligible Connection which passes the requirements for the role, you’ll need to opt-in to the role by going to the gated channel in the server and clicking to join. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I set up my Connections if I’m on mobile?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A:  Currently as a user you can view your Connections and add Connections on mobile. However, you will need to be on desktop in order to opt-in for the role by going to the gated channel. You will only need to go through the desktop connection flow once to be granted the role, and then you can view the gated channel moving forward on mobile.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GK2KFYQ2JSMHCS6ZM4C3YVQ1"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Data transparency</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: What does Discord do with the personal account details that I add to Connections?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We are storing this information to display on your profile and verify yourself for roles in servers. This information is stored securely within our databases, and will never be shared externally with third-parties without your explicit permission.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Discord sell my data from Connections to third parties?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: No.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How often are Connections details refreshed?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Discord automatically refreshes the details from your Connections on a recurring basis. However, you can also force refresh by clicking “Refresh” in the Connections tab in User Settings.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: I’ve added my Steam account to Connections, but why don’t I see any of my game data?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Discord can only see your information that is public. If you want this information to be available in Discord, you need to go into your Steam account settings and make your profile public.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Is visibility default on or off for Connections?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Visibility is default on for most Connections, except for Connections that tend to be associated with users’ real names (eg. Facebook, Spotify). You can update your visibility for Connections or Connection details in Settings &gt; Connections.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Do my Connections or Connection details need to be visible in order to qualify for a role that checks Connection details?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: No. You can opt to hide your Connection or Connection details but still be eligible for any roles that require those Connection details.</span></p>
