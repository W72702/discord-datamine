<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Those with <strong>Manage Server permissions</strong> can head over to <strong>Server Settings</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Invites</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that your invite links are paused, users will no longer be able to join your Community until you re-enable invites. Rest assured your existing invite links, embeds, and vanity URLs will still be visible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. To re-enable invites so that users can join your Community again, navigate back to <strong>Server Settings &gt; Invites</strong> and press <strong>Enable Invites</strong>. Users who now press on your invite link will be able to successfully join your Community.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GBP1JJQZ412D2VK4419RDA69"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should I pause invites to my server?</span></h1>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Community is being raided, which is when a large number of users or accounts join your Community with the express intention of causing disruption and issues. New accounts (good and bad users alike) may be joining via any of your existing invite links. You can pause invites to prevent new accounts from joining and focus on de-escalating.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pause invitations indefinitely so you don’t have to revoke your existing invite links and/or vanity URL just to set up new ones later.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let users trying to join your Community know your Community is in a paused state instead of confusing them with invalid or expired invite links.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage the growth of your Community - sometimes you just want to go into maintenance mode to freshen up your Community for new members without revoking your existing invite links.</span></li>
