<h1 id="h_01G89G9EJYNADYEYM8BVXTXWFY">Know What I Meme Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackbox</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q<strong>:</strong> Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: There is no age requirement for Know What I Meme.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select "Know What I Meme".</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I view my data for Discord-developed Activities? What data is accessed? What happens to the accessed user data?<br></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like Checkers in the Park through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. To enhance the gameplay experience, Discord Activities access and temporarily store the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord ID</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Username</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Activities played in a single session, user data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Activities that can be played across multiple sessions (like with Chess in the Park or Checkers in the Park), the user data above is retained. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Deleting your data will remove all of your progression across these Discord-developed activities.</span></h3>
