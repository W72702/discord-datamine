<p>If you’re having an issue with your Discord mobile app crashing or trouble installing the app on either iOS or Android, please try the following steps to see if this helps.</p>
<h1>Troubleshooting Steps</h1>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">1. Restart your device</span></strong></p>
<p>The turn it off and on trick can sometimes resolve an issue, so give that a go and see if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">2. Check your OS</span></strong></p>
<p>Check to make sure your mobile device is on the latest operating system by going into your device’s settings. Be sure to download and install any software updates available.  </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">3. Downloading the App</span></strong></p>
<p>Make sure you are downloading the Discord app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. Currently, our mobile app is not available for download anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">4. Clear cache and Data from the App Store (Android only)</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Clearing data will delete all of the app’s data. This means you will need to login to your Google account and set up your account settings again.</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes clearing the cache and data can help. To start you'll want to temporarily stop the app store from running in the background by force closing the application.</p>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps </strong>&gt; <strong>Google Play Store</strong> &gt; on the <strong>Play Store App</strong>, tap <strong>storage</strong> &gt; tap <strong>Clear Cache</strong> &gt; tap <strong>Clear Data</strong> &gt; tap <strong>Ok</strong> to confirm</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>5. Available phone storage</strong></span></p>
<p>Check your available storage on your device to make sure you have enough space for the Discord app. If storage is limited, try freeing up some additional space.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">6. Install over Wi-Fi or Data</span></strong></p>
<p>Try switching between Wi-Fi and data as you could be encountering network connection issues while installing or reinstalling the app.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Turn off Auto Play for emojis, GIFs, and Stickers </strong></span></p>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Accessibility </strong>&gt; turn off <strong>Automatically Play GIFs</strong>, <strong>animated Emojis, </strong>and<strong> Never animate </strong>for Stickers.</p>
