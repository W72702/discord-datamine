        <strong>Q: Why are you guys making these changes to stickers?</strong>

            <li>
                <strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to valuable feedback that we’ve gathered over the last few months, we learned that people loved our stickers and also wanted a way to upload their own. These changes enable us to keep some of the known and loved stickers around, plus give the option to upload custom content.  </span>
