<p><strong>This autopause error may also appear when using the following features with Spotify:<br>- Voice Chat<br>- Screenshare<br>- Go Live</strong></p>
<h3>Because Spotify is intended for personal and private use, the auto pause function allows us to stay in compliance with Spotify's Terms &amp; Conditions outlined at <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/</a>. </h3>
<p>To avoid this try using Push-To-Talk or adjusting your voice activity sensitivity so that your mic is not activating while you listen.
