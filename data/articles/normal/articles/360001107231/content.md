<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Servers on Discord are an indication that the server is the officially affiliated community of a business, brand, and figure of public interest. The Verification badge appears on the top left corner of a server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to apply for a Verified server, you will need to have the following requirements at a minimum:Â </span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">The applicant must both be the owner of the server and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an official representative of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business, brand, or figure of public interest.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The applicant should authenticate any other relevant social accounts on their profile to help us verify the validity of the application.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The applicant should use a formal email address related to the brand, business or entity. This will make it easier for us to understand that they hold an official position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When evaluating Discord Servers to determine if they're in the public interest and meet our verification criteria, we also look for the following:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Authentic</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your community server represents a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">registered business, brand or public figure of interest. For example, a great way to show this is having a formal email address.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Original</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your server must be the unique presence of the person or business it represents. We will only verify one official server per business / brand, though a company may have multiple brands (e.g., game franchises). There may be some exceptions, such as language or region-specific servers.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Recognizable</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We look for well-known businesses, brands, or individuals with a strong following. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take into account your social media presence - we don't consider paid or promotional content as sources for review. Your official website is taken into account but not a requirement.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Final verification is at the sole discretion of Discord.</strong> If your server doesn't meet the criteria for a verification badge, there are other ways to let people know it's authentic. For example, you can share your server invite from your official website or Twitter account.</span></p>
