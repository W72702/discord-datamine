<h2><strong>How Do I Authorize My Payments?</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you recognize the purchase on your account, go ahead and click on the </span><strong>Verify Purchase </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">button. You’ll be redirected to a new Discord landing page letting you know that your payment has been authorized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once authorized, you can go back to the app and check on the status of your purchase.</span></p>
