<p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ub</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lic spaces with many active people which can make the community an attractive target for bad actors. Thus, Community servers come equipped with a variety of safety and content moderation tools to protect members from undesirable messages containing threats like phishing links or malware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When attempting to post a message that contains content that violates the Community’s guidelines or content filters we enable for all Communities, you may receive an error notifying you that your message failed to deliver.</span></p>
<h1>Possible Reasons for This Error</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are possible reasons why you received a “Your message could not be delivered” error in a Community Server:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Your message contains content prohibited by the community</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admins and moderators of a community may be using </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AutoMod</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to set up content filters that can automatically detect and block messages containing unwanted content that the community has elected to filter out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiving this error means you tried to post a message that was flagged by any of these AutoMod filters:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keyword filters</strong> - your message contains specific words, phrases, or symbols that the community does not allow.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mention spam filter</strong> - your message contains an excessive number of unique mentions that exceeds the Community’s limit.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Spam content filter</strong> - your message contains content that has been reported as or is similar to reported spam.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce the likelihood of getting your messages flagged by AutoMod, make sure you’re correctly following the community’s #rules and #guidelines. If you still believe your message was incorrectly or unfairly blocked by AutoMod, look to ask and confirm with your local community moderator.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Your message contains a suspicious link</strong></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every Community on Discord is equipped with a suspicious link filter designed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to detect and block harmful or dangerous messages, such as those containing links to malware or phishing sites.</span></p>
<h2>How does Discord detect suspicious links?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work to identify links that might mislead or redirect users such as by reviewing a regularly updated list of unsafe and phishing websites. Some of the things we block with this filter are sites that might try to steal personal information like passwords or credit card numbers, your Discord login information, or even financial information. </span></p>
