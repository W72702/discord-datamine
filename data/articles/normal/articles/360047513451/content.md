<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an existing Discord Partner, aspiring to join the ranks of the Partner Program or just had something on your mind about Partners in general, this is the place to be! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a living document – the questions listed here will be updated as time goes on.<br></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Partner Program </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently announced some exciting changes to the Partner Program – be sure to check our announcement blog &amp; Partnership requirements while you're here.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">What’s different in the new Partner Program? Why’s it changing?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we first launched the program, our team would review applications for potential Partners based on their work on outside platforms. While this was a way to measure a community's potential growth on Discord, applicants were focused on hitting external requirements, and less on establishing an engaged community on Discord. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With newly-released tools such as Server Insights, it’s now possible to get an objective look at how your community is performing. </span></p>
<p>We’re shifting our Partnership Program to focus on quality, rewarding engaged servers with recognition and extra tools to help them invest in their community<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that Partner requirements will now primarily focus on the success of your Discord server rather than your performance on other platforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What perks do I get for being accepted to the Partner Program? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon acceptance, you’ll receive the following server and user perks: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanity URL</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server Invite Splash Images </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server Banners</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animated Server Icon</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 384kbps voice bitrate </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fancy Partner server badge</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fancy Partner profile badge for the owner</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Discord Nitro for the server owner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you transfer your Partnered server, you are opting in to also transfer your personal perks, including your Partner profile badge, and your free access to Discord Nitro.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Server Insights says my server is “actively growing.” What's that mean?</strong></span></p>
<p>We consider a server “actively growing” if it is gaining at least 20 new members on average a week. We do our best to not include users who intend to spam or raid your server. <br><br>You do not need to be actively growing to apply for Partnership. If you aren’t gaining at least 20 members a week, then your User Retention will not be checked with our requirements.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for the Discord Partner Program</span></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Can I apply for the Partner Program without a server? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nope – owning a server that qualifies for Partnership is a hard requirement. We don’t accept applications through email, or servers that are just getting started. </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Am I guaranteed Partnership if I hit the requirements to apply?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We consider our Partnership requirements the minimum requirements before applying. Your server will still be reviewed by our team after you submit an application. </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Our community would like to apply, but the owner is inactive or doesn’t want to apply. Can we apply on their behalf?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the server owner can apply for Partnership. If the server owner isn’t around or willing to apply, you will not be able to apply for the Partner Program.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the server owner has been inactive for an extended period of time, you may want to look into requesting a manual server transfer from our support team. You can reach out to them at </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047513451-Partner-Program-Mega-FAQ-" target="_self">dis.gd/contact</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>I represent a creator and I own their server. Can I apply for Partnership?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No - if the server you’re applying for is based upon the work of a content creator, then we prefer that the content creator is the one owning the server and applying.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Do I still get a physical swag for gaining Partnership?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With our new requirements potentially opening up the program to many more Partners, we’re looking into the logistics behind sending so many hoodies.<br><br>No news to share about physical merch yet, but we’ll have more info to share soon. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining Your Partnership </span></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>When I get accepted as a Partner, is it mine to keep forever? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you maintain our engagement requirements, you can stay Partnered. If you aren’t consistently reaching our requirements for 8 weeks in a row, you may be at risk of removal from the program. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>I’m already a Partner, but I haven’t reached requirements in a few weeks. What will happen to me? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> Any active Partnered server at risk of removal will be given a total of two months, or 8 weeks, to bring their partnered servers back in line with our requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">However, we will not remove Partners without ample warning. After 4 weeks of not reaching our Partnership requirements, you’ll receive a notice in your email inbox giving you a heads up. If you don’t reach requirements for the full 8 weeks, you will receive a final notice informing you of your removal from the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">You can always track your server’s progress towards Partnership, at any time, in Server Insights.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">I got removed from the Partner Program. Is this permanent? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not at all! If you leave the Partner Program due to inactivity, then build your community back up to our engagement requirements, you are more than welcome to reapply. </span></p>
