<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> are the foundation for how we work to keep you safe and ensure Discord is a space where everyone can find a place to belong. The main purpose of this update is to make our rules easier to understand. In our refreshed Community Guidelines page, you’ll see much more context and new language explaining our rules. Additionally, we are also expanding our guidelines on Financial Scams and Ban Evasion.</p>
<p>We want to ensure everyone can express themselves and find community on Discord, but never at the expense of others. Below you’ll find a summary of the key updates, but please do read the full guidelines, as they actually govern your use of Discord. The changes go into effect on <strong>March 27, 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>Our expanded guidelines on Financial Scams and Ban Evasion are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Financial Scams:</strong> <em>Do not use or attempt to use Discord to promote, coordinate, or execute financial scams. A financial scam is any intentionally deceptive act taken with the intent to receive an illegal, unethical, or otherwise dishonest gain.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Platform Ban Evasion</strong>: <em>Do not evade permanent Discord-level enforcement actions. This includes creating new or using existing accounts or communities after being removed for violating our platform rules.</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the rules above, we have also expanded what is covered under our <strong>Child Safety </strong>policies and have further clarified our policy on <strong>Dangerous and Regulated Goods.</strong> You can find these updates <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">here.</a></p>
