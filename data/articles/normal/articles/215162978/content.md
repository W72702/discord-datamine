<h3>This is only available for YouTube Partners. If your YouTube channel does not currently have memberships turned on, you will not be able to integrate your YouTube channel into your Discord server.</h3>
<p>You can create a membership-only Discord server for your YouTube channel or dedicate a few channels (or more) to only those select members.</p>
<p>To get started, you first need to connect your YouTube channel into your Discord account following the <a href="#h_01GWJBQMD6DATC8W2XQNTE4V6B" target="_self"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">How to Connect your YouTube Channel to Discord</span></a> steps above.</p>
<p>After your YouTube is connected to your Discord, now you can integrate YouTube into your server. </p>
<p>1. Navigate to your server and press on the server name in the upper left corner to open the Server Settings drop down menu. </p>
<ul>
    <li>You can also right-click on the server name to access the same menu. </li>
</ul>
<p>2. Press on <strong>Server Settings</strong> and then head to <strong>Integrations</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Follow the instructions on this page to integrate your YouTube channel into your Discord server! </p>

<h2 id="h_01GYJDT3FDP2T1YEQ37TY71VAT">Modifying Your YouTube Integration</h2>
<p>After you’ve integrated your YouTube channel, you can edit your <strong>Integration</strong> settings. </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Syncing</span></strong></p>
<p>Although your YouTube members should be synced automatically, you can always run a manual <strong>Sync</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Grace Period</span></strong></p>
<p>You can also change the <strong>Grace Period</strong> and what happens to a user once they no longer have an active membership. You can also make it so a user is kicked from the server or they just simply lose the membership role. To do this, press on the <strong>Remove Role</strong> option and select <strong>Kick</strong> instead.</p>
<p>Once you have integrated, you’ll also find that the new permissions role has been auto-created specifically for YouTube members. These roles will be named <strong>YouTube Member </strong>(for anyone that joins) and then you’ll have additional roles for each tier that you have created. For example, if you have a tier named “Plus” the auto-created role will be called <strong>YouTube Member: Plus</strong>.</p>
<p>However, you can rename these roles directly in Discord, adjust their permissions under<strong> Server Settings &gt; Roles</strong>, and even change the colors of the role. Since this role is automatically managed by the YouTube integration, you can't manually assign or delete members from it.</p>
<h3>If you have Rule Screening set up for your server for new users, they can by-pass this requirement and join a server if they become a member through your YouTube channel.</h3>

<p>If you’ve joined or been gifted a membership to a YouTube channel and you want to access their Discord server, the first thing you need to do is make sure your YouTube account is connected to your Discord account by following the steps outlined under <span class="wysiwyg-underline">How to Connect your YouTube Channel to Discord</span>.</p>
<p>After you’ve connected your YouTube channel to your Discord account, you’ll see all available YouTube channels that you’re currently subscribed to. There will be the <strong>Join</strong> option next to any server you haven’t joined yet. If you don’t see the Join option yet, don’t worry, you should see it soon! The system syncs in near real-time, and in the case of any errors, an additional sync is run by the system once a week. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Why don’t I see the option to integrate my YouTube channel to my Discord server?</strong></p>
<p>A: You need to be a YouTube partner with Channel Memberships enabled in order to integrate it into your Discord server.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I was either gifted a Membership or I joined and I don’t see the server under connections to join or have the membership role in the server? </strong></p>
