<p>The nice thing about Discord is just how awesome and easy it is to find brand new communities full of new people focused around all sorts of different topics, activities, and conversations!</p>
<p>We understand that there's a wide variety of fun things to talk about when chatting with close friends or new acquaintances, and that <strong>what might be ok for you might be unsuitable for others</strong>.</p>
<p>To help keep age-restricted content in a dedicated spot that's clearly labeled, we've added a channel setting that allows you to designate a text channel in your server (or multiple channels!) as age-restricted.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When enabled, anyone that opens the channel will be greeted with a notification letting them know that the channel may contain adult content:</span></p>

<h2 id="h_adc93a2c-8fc3-4775-be02-bbdbfcde5010">Setting Up the Channel </h2>
<p>To designate a channel as age-restricted, start by clicking the edit channel icon next to the channel you'd like to mark:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360007746112/1.png" alt="1.png"> </p>
<p>Within the edit channel overview tab, you'll see an option to mark the channel as age-restricted. Click that option, and you'll be good to go!</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that while having a dedicated place for your age-restricted content is ok by Discord standards, there's still some material that isn't appropriate anywhere in Discord.</p>
<p>If you're unsure of what qualifies as ok or not, check out our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Community Guidelines</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: <br></strong>Take a <strong>photo of yourself</strong> that includes yourself holding the following items:</p>
