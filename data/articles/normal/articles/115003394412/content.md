<p>Sometimes when a new release is pushed, your anti-virus software may return false positives and block the download or installation of the update.</p>
<p>If this happens, please temporarily disable your AV software to allow the update to install, and then you can turn it back on again!</p>
<p>If you're still having troubles with the new update, try the steps in <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209099387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> to see if that helps!</p>
