<h2 id="h_01H44CRFX79SPBEDH3S42MFMQM">Desktop/Browser </h2>
<p>To connect your account with your teen, you’ll first need to have the <a href="https://discord.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord app</a> installed on your mobile device. While you can get started with and access Family Center on a browser, you can only complete the connection process with your teen by using the Discord mobile app. After installing the app or opening Discord, tap on <strong>Family Center </strong>in <strong>User Settings</strong> and toggle the <strong>Enable Family Center tab</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15673617018391" alt="image3.gif"></p>
<p>To connect to your teen in Family Center, your teen needs to provide you with the generated QR code that is located in their Family Center tab under the <strong>Connect with Parent </strong>option. Scan the QR code with your Discord app and after your teen accepts the connection, you’ll both have full access to Family Center!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/15673625197847" alt="image5.png"></p>
<p>Once connected, you can head into Family Center by tapping on <strong>My Family</strong> to see any connected teens there.</p>

<h1 id="h_01H44CSKW8G8J9KBEB64YSN2CV">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why can I only see the last 7 days of activity?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our goal is to surface information in ways that are timely, not overwhelming, and helpful in starting conversations about online safety. Family Center highlights information in a 7 day period in order to provide contextually relevant information for parents and guardians.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Discord thinks my teen is 25 but they are actually 13. How can I update their age?</strong></p>
<p>A: When a user signs up for Discord, we ask for their age to verify that they meet the minimum age requirement in their country. It sounds like your teen may have made an error when inputting their date of birth. To correct this, please have your teen contact Discord at<a href="http://dis.gd/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> dis.gd/request</a> &gt; <strong>Update My Age Information</strong>. Be sure to have them include their actual age in their request.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I flag inappropriate activity to Discord?</strong></p>
<p>A: As a parent, we encourage you to spend some time reviewing and discussing your teen’s settings so that you can customize their Discord experience and avoid unwanted experiences. You can learn more about Discord’s safety settings <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360043653552-age-restricted-content-on-discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, if your teen encounters a violation of our Community Guidelines please have them submit an in-app report of the behavior by <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following the instructions here</a>.</p>
<p>In sensitive situations, if you would like to report the behavior on your teen's behalf, you can do so by <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following the instructions here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My teen won't allow me to connect Family Center, how can I make them?</strong></p>
<p>A: Both parents/guardians and teens must voluntarily opt into connecting to Family Center. If your teen has additional questions about information shared via Family Center they can learn more <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14155060633623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. We encourage you to talk with your teen to customize a Discord experience that is right for the whole family.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can't I link to my teen’s account? </strong></p>
<p>A: If a user has their age set to 18 or older, you will not be able to link to their account. Your teen will have to correct their age on Discord before you are able to link to the account.</p>
<p>To do this, please have your teen contact Discord at<a href="http://dis.gd/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> dis.gd/request</a> &gt; <strong>Update My Age Information</strong>. Be sure to have them include their actual age in their request.</p>
<p>Please note that Discord has minimum age requirements depending on the country your teen is in. In most countries, the minimum age to use Discord is 13.<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000159622-Why-Is-Discord-Asking-For-My-Birthday-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> You can review Discord’s minimum age requirements by country here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I lock safety settings on my teen’s account?</strong></p>
<p>A: Family Center is designed to be a tool to help parents and teens have conversations about safe and healthy use of Discord. We encourage you to talk to your teen about how to customize settings in a way that supports your family's safety goals.</p>
<p>Learn more about Discord's settings <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I join a server my teen is in?</strong></p>
<p>A: Every server on Discord is different and each has their own custom join settings and rules around invites to fit the needs of the community.</p>
<p>To learn more about a server your teen is a part of, we encourage you to discuss and review the server together.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can't I see all of my teens' friends?</strong></p>
<p>A: Family Center is designed to provide parents with their teens' recent activity. At this time we only provide information about their activity on Discord within the last seven days. This includes the number of users they’ve messaged or called, the number of new friends they’ve added, and how many servers they’re actively participating in. Family Center won’t contain a complete archive of activity and will only highlight activity occurring after your teen has accepted your connection request. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I make changes to my teen's friend list or joined servers?</strong></p>
<p>A: Family Center does not allow any connected parent to make modifications or changes to their teen’s friend list or joined servers on their teen’s behalf. For security and privacy reasons, only account owners can make modifications on their account. </p>
<p>As a parent/guardian, we encourage you to leverage Family Center as a way to spend some time reviewing and discussing your teen’s settings so that you can help customize their Discord experience. We’ve outlined some discussion starters and tips for helping keep your teen safe on Discord here:<a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord</a></p>
<p><strong>Q: How many teens can I connect to in Family Center?</strong></p>
<p>A: Parents and guardians are able to connect to a maximum of 8 accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I don't want my teen talking to this user, can I do anything?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you feel uncomfortable with someone your teen is engaging with, we encourage you to talk to your teen about your concerns. We want to make you aware of the <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-Helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools available to your teen on Discord</a>, such as our explicit image and spam filters. You can also block specific users who you or your teen do not wish to communicate with anymore. Instructions on how to do so can be found <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Discord takes our teen users' security and safety very seriously. If you believe there is a violation of our Community Guidelines, we ask that you report this behavior to us. You can find more information on how to submit a request <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I accidentally remove my teen’s connection, do they need to re-allow me to connect?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. For security and privacy reasons, once a parent has disconnected from a teen, they must go through the connection process again in order to re-establish their connection with that teen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I see if another user is connected to my teen in Family Center?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, connected parents and guardians can see every account their teen has connected to in Family Center. An email confirmation with the newly linked account will be sent to the email address associated to the parent/guardian Discord account.</p>
