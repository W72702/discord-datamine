<p>With the View as Role feature, you can get a better understanding and see the perspective of your own server from another role!</p>

<h1 id="h_01EJT8TC0K8656RBPC37QFASF6">Who can View as Role in Your Server? </h1>
<p>Only the server owner and server members with a role with "Administrator" permission can use this feature in the server!</p>
<p>If you don't have a role with the "Administrator" permission in the server, you won't be able to view this option!</p>
<h3>Note: Giving the "Administrator" permission to a user grants them all of the permissions in the permissions list! Assign this permission with caution. </h3>
<h2 id="h_01EJT97AD5VRTCY5YRSJAQ1H34">What Can you See Using View as Role? </h2>
<p>Using the View as Role feature, server owners and admins will be able to double check permissions such as: </p>
<ul>
    <li>What text channels or categories a role can view</li>
    <li>What voice channels a role can connect to</li>
    <li>What channels have Read Message History permission enabled for a specific role</li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of server settings a role can access/change (ex: Manage Server, Manage Nickname, etc!)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Note: Because voice restrictions are tied to the user, View as Role doesn't reflect voice restrictions like suppression or priority speaker.</h3>
