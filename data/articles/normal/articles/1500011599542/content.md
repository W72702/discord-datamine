<h1 id="h_01F68GC64B6F29QF5NRBRJVR2C">What is Stage Discovery?</h1>
<p>For Community owners of all sizes and subcultures, Stage Discovery will allow you to open up your Stage events to anyone on Discord, beyond just current members of your server. We believe public Stages can be a great way to welcome new members in and grow your community, so we’re excited for you to try it out.</p>
<p>Discord users can utilize the new Stage Discovery feature to join different Stage events, and if they like the event and the people behind it, they can also join the community.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F68GCD7PJMYN6H2XEA1SKPTT">Is this different from Server Discovery?</h2>
<p>Yes, Server Discovery allows users to browse different public Servers. Stage Discovery allows users to browse public Stages. Any Community server can create a public Stage channel that is discoverable for users regardless of whether they are a public server.</p>
<p>To learn more about <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Server Discovery check out this article</a>.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Can I feature any other type of channel in Discovery?</strong></span></p>
<p>As of right now, only Stage channels are eligible to be featured in Discovery.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">What are Stage Channels and how do I set one up?</span></strong></p>
<p>For information on how to set up a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage Channel please see our article here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Will everyone be able to access Stage Discovery?</strong></span></p>
<p>At launch Stage Discovery will only be available in the following countries: US, AU, CA, GB. We are working fast to expand this new feature out to all of our countries soon!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What platforms will Stage Discovery be available on?</strong></span></p>
<p>At launch Stage Discovery will be available on Desktop, iOS, and Android, but limited to the countries listed above at launch.</p>
<h2 id="h_01F68GCKF893D6XQSEWF3BQJ3G">How are Stages recommended in Stage Discovery?</h2>
<p>The goal of Stage Discovery is to help people discover events and communities that are of interest to them.</p>
<p>If a user has personalization enabled, a machine learning model will attempt to match you with events in communities that we think you’ll like. To do this, the model looks at factors like what Stages are trending, what relationships exist between communities, and what communities you participate in. The model does not look at the contents of anything you post within Discord.</p>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reminder: you can decide whether Discord personalizes your Stage Discovery experience with the “Use data to customize my Discord experience” setting under “Privacy and Safety.” If you have personalization turned off, your Stage Discovery page will not be based on any information about you or how you use Discord.</span></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time to time, we may also highlight certain content that we think will be appealing to the community. This content will be labeled as “featured” or something similar so you can easily identify it in the Stage Discovery tab.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01F68GCWNX7A77NJHMPVBP3S4X"><strong>Can I ban someone from a Stage channel?</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage channels work just like voice channels. Stage moderators can kick people out of the Stage channel, however that member can still rejoin.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to ensure someone cannot come back to the Stage channel you will need to ban them from the server or remove their permission from being able to see and join the channel.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01F68GD5X89REPSP02C2YE0SJH"><strong>What about people I’ve blocked?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Joining a room with people you blocked:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> block a person, then we will warn you if you join a room where they are also present (either as a moderator, speaker, or listener). The blocked person won't get notified but can see that you are in the same room.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Request/Invite to speak in a room with people blocked:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">request to speak or are invited to speak in a room where blocked people are present, then we will prompt you to make sure you are aware that blocked people are present in the room and you are OK with proceeding.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blocked people joining your room</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not get a notification if blocked people join a room you are already in, but you will still get one if you request/are invited to speak with that person still in the room. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01F68GDDKKNTQ5EHXNA83ESAJZ"><strong>How do I report a Stage Channel?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On desktop, you can right-click on a Stage Channel and click on <strong>“Report Stage”</strong> if you believe that the Stage is in violation of our </span><a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Guidelines</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010879761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage Guidelines</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500018821182/report.gif" alt="report.gif"></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">On mobile, you can open up the report Stage option by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the Stage</span></strong></h3>
<h2 id="h_01F68GDMT7FS9DGPN002CTKXZ2"><strong>What rules do public Stage Channels need to follow?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone on Discord needs to follow the <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> at all times. Stages must also follow these <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010879761-Stage-Channel-Guidelines-">Stage Guidelines.</a> </span></strong></p>
<h1 id="h_01F68GE7WGQ6TQEA8PKEGGXSZ5"><strong>Creating a public Stage</strong></h1>
<h2 id="h_01F68GEP2R97J9PXX5PS565VCQ"><strong>How do I make my Stage public so it appears in Stage Discovery?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about how to set up a Stage channel including how to make it public, check out </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722-Stage-Channels-FAQ#h_01F22MRRG3GX0ZK0F575KT4S4A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this article. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you set your Stage public, it also opens your server to be viewable and joinable by anyone who is listening in to your Stage. However, it does not place you into Server Discovery. </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, listeners to the Stage do not join the server. However, they will have the option to view and join it during the event, just as if they have an invite link.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will still have to respect any screening or verification process you have in place. </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your Stage has ended, your server will no longer be able to be accessible.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, you cannot make a public Stage without also making your server joinable during the event. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, make sure to reference and follow our </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010879761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage Channel Guidelines</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What happens when people join my Stage channel from Stage Discovery?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People joining your Stage from Stage Discovery will act like any other audience member joining from your community. They will be placed in the audience and muted by default. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Do listeners who join my Stage from Discovery also join my community?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, listeners to the Stage do not join the server. However, they will have the option to view and join it during the event, just as if they have an invite link. They will still have to respect any screening or verification process you have in place. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Will I be able to know who joined the Stage from my community versus Stage Discovery?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, there will not be a distinction for audience members who joined through Discovery or through the server directly.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01F68GEVY1HRYASX05T73HGX13"><strong>Joining a public Stage</strong></h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What happens when I join a Stage from Stage Discovery?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When joining a Stage from Stage Discovery, you automatically start to listen in to the server’s Stage event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, you will join as a lurker and will not be a permanent member of the server. All other Stage defaults apply: you will join as an audience with your mic muted. You can request to speak if you want, but otherwise, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the conversation. </span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>I like this Stage and the people in it. Can I join the server from the Stage?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! If you love what you’re hearing you can click into the Stage Channel and be brought to the community that is hosting the event. From there, you can click the nag bar at the top of your screen to join the Community and connect with other members!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: If a community has any screening or verification set up you will still need to complete those steps before you can become a full member and talk. <br><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500018816862/bag_bar.png" alt="bag_bar.png"></span></h3>
