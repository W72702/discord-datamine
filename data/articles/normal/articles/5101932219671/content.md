<p><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Putt Party is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_self">Activity</a> that we've developed here at Discord. It is our putting golf game that you can play with your friends! Play through themed courses simultaneously as you try to get your ball in the hole in the fewest amount of strokes. Scattered throughout the courses are power-ups that can be used to make your shots easier, or your opponent’s shots harder. Players who complete the course in the fewest amount of strokes are the winners!</span></p>

<p>There are many different ways you can launch Putt Party in the Discord app for you and your friends! Whether in a server’s voice channel or in a direct message, you can check out <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Activities on Discord</span></a> for instructions on how to start any Activity.</p>
<h3><strong>Note: Putt Party is a game for 1-8 players. However, more members can join the activity as spectators and join the queue to play in future rounds.</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>HOW TO PLAY PUTT PARTY</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Select a mode! </strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img style="height: 351px; width: 624px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14694131401623"></span></strong></p>
<p>Casual Mode is one course with six holes, and the score tallies for just that course. Players vote for the next one when the current one is complete. Play as many or as few courses as you want!<br>Tournament Mode lets you pick the number of courses to play - either 3, 6, or 9 courses, each with six holes. Courses are selected at random, and the powerups you earn in one course will carry over to the next. The score is tallied over all the courses.</p>
<p>Move your ball! Select, drag, aim, and release to launch.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img style="height: 349px; width: 624px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14694148408727"></span></strong></p>
<p>Move towards the hole in as few moves as possible! Each hole has a par, which is what a proficient Putt Party player would likely score on that hole.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img style="height: 352px; width: 624px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14694131415831"></span></strong></p>
<p>Use powerups! If you collide with a <strong>?</strong> block, you will receive a random powerup. Some will provide benefits for you while others will be detrimental to your opponents. All detrimental powerups affect all other plays, except Steal, which targets one player.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: <span id="docs-internal-guid-c301695d-7fff-7b3d-41f6-5adf440b60b2">There is no age requirement for Putt Party. By using the Putt Party activity you are agreeing to follow Discord </span><a href="https://discord.com/guidelines"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Community Guidelines</span></a> and Discord <a href="https://discord.com/terms"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Terms of Service</span></a>.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select "Putt Party".'</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href="https://dis.gd/bugreport">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Checkers in the Park</em> through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_self">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To enhance the gameplay experience, Discord Activities access and temporarily store the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>Discord ID</li>
    <li>Avatar</li>
    <li>Username</li>
</ul>
<p>For Activities played in a single session, user data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained.</p>
<p>For Activities that can be played across multiple sessions (like with Chess in the Park or Checkers in the Park), the user data above is retained.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Note: Deleting your data will remove all of your progression across these Discord-developed activities.</strong></em></h3>
