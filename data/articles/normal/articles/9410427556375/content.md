<p>Discord uses multiple techniques to capture an application window for Go Live and Screen Share. We are thrilled to introduce a new capture method for Windows user: <strong>Windows Graphics Capture</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Graphics Capture</strong> is available on Windows 10 and above and is the latest Windows API to capture an application window.</p>
<p>Discord uses multiple technologies to capture your screen. Our current default capture method uses similar technology to capture your screen that is used for overlay - "<strong>Use our advanced technology to capture your screen</strong>". Our signed DLL is injected into the application to extract rendered frames as they are being sent to Windows for display.</p>
<p>On Windows 11 and higher, we will change the default capture method to Windows Graphics Capture. Unfortunately, it does not work for full screen exclusive (FSE) games.</p>
<p>We use <code>SHQueryUserNotificationState</code> to determine whether the game is running in full screen exclusive mode. However, this method may give false positive and we fall back to other capture methods.</p>
<h2>How do I check which capture method is used?</h2>
<p>If you enable <strong>Developer Mode</strong> under Advanced User Settings, you can open Debug panel by clicking <strong>Voice/Video Connected</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Screen Share</strong> tab, Discord shows the number of frames captured for each screen share method.</p>

<h2>How do I check whether the game is running in full screen exclusive mode?</h2>
<p>Open <strong>Xbox Game Bar (Windows + G)</strong>. If the game minimizes, it uses FSE. If Xbox Game Bar renders smoothly on top of your game, it uses borderless fullscreen.</p>
<p>Certain games offer to use the <strong>Full Screen</strong> or <strong>Borderless</strong> option. If the Full Screen option is selected, we may misclassify the game as using FSE and disable Windows Graphics Capture.</p>
<p>If you would like to get the best screen share performance, please select the <strong>Borderless</strong> option.</p>
