<p>If you're hearing distortion in voice chat it's typically a sign of a connection issue which can vary from your connection to hiccups with our servers. The most common fix to the distortion is to have your server owner/admin switch the server region, in server settings &gt; overview, to a server that is closest to your physical location. If you're already on a server closest to your physical location select the next closest one to see if the distortion persist.</p>
<p>If the distortion subsides once you switch server regions. Hang out there for a bit and let the original server region resolve itself before switching back. </p>
