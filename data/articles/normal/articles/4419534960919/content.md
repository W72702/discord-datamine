<p><strong>Q: Why won't my PlayStation Network status display when I'm streaming, listening to Spotify, or having a different game open on my computer?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: This is due to how the client interacts with presence from other devices and activities. In other words, what you do locally on your computer will always take priority for what you see as an Activity status. In addition, </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001557452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rich presence</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take priority over basic presence; which means the PlayStation Network integration won't display while you're also listening to Spotify or playing games which support rich presence.</span></p>
