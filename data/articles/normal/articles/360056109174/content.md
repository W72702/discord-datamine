<p>Our engineering team is working with the iCloud email admins to resolve this issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, we would recommend, if you're able, changing your Discord email, and if you're unable, write in a support ticket at <a href="https://dis.gd/contact">https://dis.gd/contact</a> so we can let you know when the issue is resolved.</p>
<h3>If you run into any other questions or concerns, feel free to drop us a line either <a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_self">directly</a> or via <a href="https://www.twitter.com/discord" target="_self">Twitter</a>. </h3>
