<h1 id="h_01ET2R15GVPGXAXQCBQG1R276E">What is Rules Screening?</h1>
<p>Rules screening allows you to set up rules that new members must explicitly agree to before they can talk, react, or DM Other members.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500000511182/rules_banner.png" alt="rules_banner.png"></p>
<h3>Note: Granting a role to a new member will bypass this requirement.</h3>
<h1 id="h_01ET2R1CF3FQHHZGHM9HD5JQHS">Admin Settings</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server Admins can customize their rules and review applications by heading over to <strong>Server Settings</strong>, and then head to the <strong>Rules Screening</strong> tab under the Moderation category in the left side bar!</span></p>

    <strong>Note:</strong> <br>- We know communities often need more sophisticated screening methods like custom response/manual application, oAuth, and third party connections. <br>- We are hard at work building these features so that we can release them to you soon as well! We sadly don't have an exact ETA when these features will be released, but stay tuned for more details soon!

<h2 id="h_01ET2R2635V2K7JNCR9F787Z2Y">User Rules Screening (Auto)</h2>
<p>As a user, when you join a server with <strong>Rules Screening (Auto)</strong> enabled, you will see a bar at the bottom that asks you to complete a few more steps before you can talk.Â </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500000617221/bar.png" alt="bar.png"></p>
<p>Before you can participate in the server, you will need to read and agree to the Server Rules.Â </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500000617461/Screenshot_99.png" alt="Screenshot_99.png"></p>
<p>Once you agree to the rules, press submit and you will have access to the server!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360099490614/Screenshot_100.png" alt="Screenshot_100.png"></p>

    <strong>Note:</strong> Before proceeding further - <br>- If you have a bot role gate currently enabled, make sure you re-enable perms on <span class="mention wrapper-3WhCwL mention" tabindex="-1">@everyone</span> when you enact Rules Screening to ensure it works properly. <br>- We've ensured that pending members are not able to talk, dm, or react until they've accepted the rules.

<h1 id="h_01ET2R2HXM849ZVSC7E3WRFJJ0">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I currently use a role gating through a third-party bot to have members agree to rules should I use this instead?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: While it is not a requirement to switch, we do believe this is a much more frictionless way to encourage new members to agree to rules and seamlessly get them in your community and participating.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I don't currently use role gating on my server. Should I set up rules screening now?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: If you would like new members to explicitly agree to rules, Rules Screening is an easy way to set it up. However, do note that it will add another step to joining your server which can sometimes lead to a drop off in joiners.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Are there other types of membership screening capabilities?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Rules screening is our only currently available membership screening capability, however, we are actively working on more options that we hope to release soon.</span></p>
