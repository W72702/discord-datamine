<p>Hello there! If you’ve found your way to this Help Center article, you’ve likely gained access to a new mobile layout that we are testing with a limited number of users. If you’ve been using Discord for a while now, you probably noticed the mobile layout was designed to reflect the desktop layout. With this new iteration of Discord on mobile, we hope to make the mobile experience feel like it was optimized for your mobile device rather than a scaled-down desktop app. The new mobile design aims to simplify and improve the Discord experience for everyone by creating a more organized, more streamlined, and better-looking mobile app that helps you get to your chats quickly and easily. </p>
<p>We’re actively gathering feedback during the testing period to ensure that we continue to provide the best experience on Discord. For those of you that have already tried the mobile app, thank you for all the thoughtful feedback you've shared with us so far! We've been paying great attention to it and it's helping us continue to make improvements. If you’re new to this version of the app, be sure to explore the new mobile layout and give it a heartfelt try. And if it doesn’t work, that’s okay — you’re welcome to turn it off and go back to the old look (more on that below), but we’d love to know how your experience went. If something doesn’t work for you, please let us know so we can continue to improve upon this new mobile app design! </p>
<p>This Help Center article will explain the core changes to the mobile layout, how you can provide feedback and thoughts on what does or doesn’t work for you, and how to opt out if you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Some of the changes and features outlined in this article are still experiments and you may not see them in your app even if you are using the new layout.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h_01H78YWFNY76BQ6SJKX33KF500">Servers Tab</h2>
<p>In the new mobile layout, your servers are in their own dedicated “Servers” tab, located at the bottom-left corner of the app. Once you open the “Servers” tab, you’ll see all of your servers at the bottom of the screen in a row. The servers on the left side of the divider stay where they are unless you re-order them yourself. The server on the right side of the divider is your most recently accessed server and it can change. Tapping on a server will open it within the “Servers” tab and allow you to scroll through and open that server’s channels.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 584.7696951660218; width: 270px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Bx6Xqjkff5jvJya1FLOWTOgMzB0PDWptxfFxjdkp5BvLnU9aheqtJcTsPqiFKABu2kQZSo-MtW7Lzu9nsNm2b4fYmLAnUY_v8ZakGkzn_ZkSNBs8l5w2X9oD3FQUVyTufclTGxL0sjG1-0fyt8ZbhJI"></p>
<p>You can swipe up on the sheet to search through all your servers at once. You can use the search bar at the top of this page to search for specific servers. </p>

<p>To re-order your servers, tap and hold one of the servers in this view and select ‘Sort’. From the resulting screen, you can tap and hold on a server name and move it up or down to sort it among your other servers. The order of your servers is synced across the desktop and mobile apps.</p>

<p>You can see what is happening in a server in real time by checking the Active Now section at the top of that server. In servers, Active Now can show things such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Voice Channels that are currently in use and which members are in them</li>
    <li>Which members are currently streaming in the server</li>
    <li>When members are playing an activity in the server</li>
    <li>Which channels have recent messages</li>
    <li>The members of the server and their status</li>

<p>You can favorite channels within a server so that they stay pinned to the top of the server on your app.</p>
<p>To favorite a channel within a server, navigate to the server where you want to favorite a channel → tap and hold the channel name → and select “Favorite”. You will then see the channel move from its current location to the top of the server in the Favorites category. This does not affect the location of the channel within the server for other members. If you want to see one of your favorited channels return to its set location within the server, you can repeat the same process and select “Unfavorite” to remove the channel from your favorites for that server.</p>

<p>You can search through all of the messages and content shared within a server by swiping down from the top of the server and tapping the search bar. </p>
<p>From here, you can search messages across the entire server and limit the results to just channels, shared media, Pins, Links, and Files using the filters under the search bar.</p>

<p>When viewing a channel, tap the name of the channel at the top of the screen to open the channel details page. From this page, you can search for messages sent in that channel, see its members and their statuses, and filter for the media, GIFs, files, and links shared in that channel. You could use this page to find a specific photo that you sent in the channel but don’t remember when you sent it. By selecting the “Media” filter, you can browse all of the images and videos sent in that channel quickly without having to scroll through the whole chat history. Note that you will only be able to see images or videos shared in spaces that you can access within a server.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H78YX7KE1BTX3T3XRK0AVQVA">Messages Tab</h2>
<p>Your Direct Messages (DMs) and Group DMs (GDMs) are now located in a dedicated “Messages” tab in the app. You can now search across all of your DMs and GDMs to find the chat you’re looking for using the search bar at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>We simplified your notifications experience to emphasize the things you can uniquely find in the Notifications tab, like friend requests. We combined the 'For You' and 'Mentions' tabs to create a centralized space for catching up on everything you missed while you were away. All notifications in the Notifications tab are actionable: Join an event, message someone who just accepted your friend request, etc. You no longer need to click a notification for it to be considered read in the Notifications tab, just seeing it is enough. The next time you return to the Notifications tab, all read notifications will be de-emphasized and new notifications will be emphasized so you always know what’s new and don’t have to actively clear your notifications. Red badges will persist on the Notifications tab when you have pending friend requests, and you must resolve your pending friend requests to clear them.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H78Z4MTG2HN9MK9NH1MS4VDX">You Tab</h2>
<p>The “You” tab is your dedicated space to view and customize how you appear to others on Discord. You can find the “You” tab in the bottom right corner of the app. From this tab, you can easily edit your profile, set your status, view your friends, or manage your settings. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 753px; width: 312px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1J9n_n75_7Kn64hVCbYzK8JSGLtmSrJWYBrlgI6N3OqURBNmmACmKL5OBp7rWH-96ioOt2gQgj9TxMT6BzJt443IanpVsF0B1YycibMLxTrgOk6uOJIAZO8eY6FiVTQjjZpcXrbSrqIOZ8avXQyCHvY"></p>

<p>App Settings are still in this tab and you can now access them by tapping the gear icon at the top right of the “You” tab. </p>
<p>You can now search within Settings. It’s a small but mighty improvement. Now, you don't have to waste time scrolling through every single setting to find what you're looking for. Simply type in the search bar and watch the magic happen.</p>

<h2 id="h_01H78Z01FFM9K93PXN98336N4X">Voice &amp; Video Calls</h2>
<p>We’ve updated the interface for voice and video calls. Before joining a voice call, you can easily preview the Text in Voice for that call without joining the call by tapping the quote icon to the right of the “Join Voice” button. Tap the microphone icon to the left of the “Join Voice” button to control whether you will enter the call muted or unmuted. You must tap the “Join Voice” button to enter a voice call.</p>

<p>We added swipe-to-reply on messages for faster witty retorts. Simply swipe from right to left across a message in a DM or channel to reply to that message. </p>
<p>Previously swiping from right to left across a channel or DM/GDM would take you to see the details of that chat such as pinned messages or a list of who is in the channel or DM/GDM. To access channel or DM/GDM details, tap on the name of the DM/GDM or Channel at the top of the screen.</p>
