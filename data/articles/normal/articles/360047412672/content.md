<p>If you are below the age of 13, the Nitro perk in your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate menu will not be shown as Discord is not intended for use by those under the age of 13 and our Terms of Service state that you must be at least 13 years of age to use the service. <a href="https://discord.com/terms">https://discord.com/terms </a></p>
<p>If that is not the case and you are above 13 years of age, contact the Xbox Support team directly to review this further through this link: <a href="https://support.Xbox.com/contact-us">https://support.Xbox.com/contact-us</a> !</p>
<p>If you're a PC user, you can file a bug report directly to the Feedback Hub following the steps in this link here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app</a> !</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why doesn't my Discord Nitro code work when I try to redeem it?</strong></span><br>A: If you've previously subscribed to Nitro, Nitro Classic or Server Boosting on your Discord account at any point in time, you won't be able to claim this 3 month perk! However, this code can be gifted to a friend! </p>
<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, Nitro Classic or Server Boosting, please submit a ticket through our support system: <a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_self">https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further. (Be sure to include your full <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord ID</a> and your Gamertag.)</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "This code has already been redeemed" error when I try to apply my Nitro code!</strong></span><br>A: if you are seeing a "<strong>This gift has been redeemed already</strong>" error, that means that the Nitro code has already used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've redeemed this code on another Discord account.</p>
<p>In particular, if you claimed this code using your mobile device, double check the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, once the code has been redeemed, the code cannot be re-enabled to be redeemable once more, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Already Purchased" error when I try to apply my Nitro code!</strong></span><br>A: If you are seeing an "<strong>Already Purchased</strong>" error message when you try to apply the Nitro promo link, that means you have previously activated a promotion and therefore are no longer eligible to redeem another promotion link.</p>
<p>However, you can give this link to a friend to use instead!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Unknown Gift Code" error when I try to apply my Nitro code! </strong></span><br>If you're seeing an<strong> Unknown Gift Code</strong> error, that means that the link is invalid! If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link shown in the Perks menu in your Xbox Game Pass app!</p>
<p>If you received this code from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their Perks menu! Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I’m having trouble with my Microsoft account!</strong></span><br>A: Please contact the Xbox support team at: <a href="https://support.Xbox.com/contact-us">https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
