<h1><strong>HOW TO USE YOUR NITRO GIFT</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your gift will appear in your gift inventory on </span><strong>Desktop </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">under </span><strong>User Settings &gt; Gift Inventory within 30 days </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you’ll need to redeem it through the desktop app.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you already have:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Nitro Classic Monthly, Nitro Classic Yearly, or Monthly Nitro on desktop: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have two options:</span>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrade to Nitro Yearly first by paying the prorated amount, then redeem the gift. This allows you to keep your Nitro subscription consistent, maintaining your Nitro badge subscription date. </span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancel your current subscription, wait for the subscription to end, then redeem your gift. You won’t need to pay any difference here. </span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <strong>A yearly Nitro subscription that you purchased on desktop</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can accept the gift and it will extend your subscription time before needing to pay again. </span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <strong>A Nitro subscription that you purchased on mobile</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you need to cancel your current subscription, wait until it ends, then use the desktop app to claim your gift. </span>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Note: <br></strong>- The subscription will automatically renew at the end of your year, and you’ll need to manually cancel it if you don’t want to be charged.<br>- You can find more information on Nitro Gifting <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001829622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
