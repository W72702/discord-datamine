<p id="docs-internal-guid-6d45fc83-7fff-615f-70c5-c17129451b8f">We are changing our username system to make it easier for you to connect with your friends and to give you more control over your identity on Discord! </p>
<p>Since 2015, every Discord username has been cAsE sEnSitIvE and had a number attached to it called <span id="docs-internal-guid-383e0115-7fff-1218-426e-7d4c3cb1d95d">a Discord tag or sometimes known as</span> a discriminator (e.g., #0001). This lets you have the same username as someone else as long as you have different discriminators or different case letters. However, this also means you have to remember a set of 4-digit numbers and account for case sensitivity to connect with your friends. </p>
<p>We wanted to make it easier for you to identify and add your friends while preserving your ability to use your preferred name across Discord. So, <span class="wysiwyg-underline">we are removing tags/discriminators and introducing new, unique usernames and display names.</span></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-bd0d3045-7fff-fe16-06ce-29d7f55beedb">Over the coming weeks, every user will become eligible to change their username from their old username with the Discord tag/discriminators (#0000) to <strong>a new username without discriminators</strong>. All users will eventually be required to pick a new, unique username to use Discord.</p>
<p>Because they will be unique to each user, new usernames will make it easier to identify and connect with your friends. Your new username will be unique to you, so share it with your friends when you want them to connect with you.</p>
<p>New usernames are <strong>lowercase, alphanumeric, limited to certain special characters</strong>, <strong>and do not have discriminators</strong>, making them easier to remember, read, type, and share.</p>

<p>Your display name can be almost anything (within <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord’s Community Guidelines</a>), <span id="docs-internal-guid-fb61863b-7fff-ffee-0eed-b94d8d8a22d2"> </span><strong>including special characters, spaces, and emojis</strong>!

<p>When you pick your new username, your display name will be pre-populated with your old username so your friends recognize you, but you can always change it in your profile settings by navigating to <strong>User Settings</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>My Account</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Profiles</strong>.</p>

<p>Because new usernames are unique to each user, they primarily serve as unique identifiers <strong>for friend requests and for validating the identity of other users on Discord</strong>. </p>
<p>When receiving message requests or friend requests from other users, you can use the combination of their display name and new, unique username to validate who they are.</p>

Owners of partner and verified servers will become eligible first, followed by all users based on the age of their account, starting with 2015. Current Nitro subscribers paying for the ability to customize their discriminator that were registered on or before March 1, 2023 will also be given early access. This includes users that were on a Nitro or Nitro Classic plan on March 1, 2023, and remained active on either of those plans throughout the months leading to the new username rollout. When you are eligible to update your username, we will notify you in the app.</span></span></p>

Eventually, all users will be required to pick a new username to access Discord.</span> We will let you know in the app when that time is approaching. However, we suggest that you pick a new username when you become eligible, as that is when you will have the best chance of getting the username you want.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the difference between usernames, display names, and nicknames?</strong></p>
<p>A. <strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-0809674f-7fff-044f-108f-5e2af7fee743">New Usernames</span></strong>, <span id="docs-internal-guid-627c2ece-7fff-fda5-21a9-177fd0a2319a">also referred to as Unique Usernames, are unique to each user and serve as a unique identifier for each user.</span> You can use them to add friends and verify who you are talking to on Discord.<br><strong>Display Names</strong>, are how you show up across Discord. Display names are not unique to each user and can be set to whatever you want, whenever you want (within <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord’s Community Guidelines</a>). <span class="wysiwyg-underline">In direct messages, friend requests, and servers where you do not have a server nickname, you will appear as your display name.</span><br><strong>Friend nicknames </strong>are names that you set for other users for your DMs. You can see the friend nicknames that you set for your friends in your DMs, but they cannot see them from their app. Friend nicknames take priority over display names where they are set in the app.<br><strong>Server nicknames</strong> are names that you either set for yourself in specific servers OR are set for you in a server by someone with permissions. Server nicknames take priority over display names where they are set in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How will I know if my friend is using an old username or a new username?</strong></p>
<p>A. <span id="docs-internal-guid-8568d58f-7fff-6c84-bfca-f255086ce00d">Old usernames have a tag with discriminators at the end (#0000), can be uppercase or lowercase, and use special characters. <span id="docs-internal-guid-bf459cff-7fff-7e38-4f72-0d681cadf29a">New usernames are all lowercase, and alphanumeric.</span><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Q. I dismissed the notification letting me know I can change my username, how can I update my Username?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q. Once I change my username can I go back to having a discriminator?</strong></p>
<p>A. <span id="docs-internal-guid-1436c758-7fff-5058-aa55-2e5903c87ccc">No, once you pick a new username, you will no longer have a discriminator as part of your username. Remember, we’re getting rid of discriminators for everyone. When you change your username again, you will not have the option of providing a discriminator or reverting to your old username with the discriminator.</span></p>

<p>A. No. These changes are for all users.</p>
