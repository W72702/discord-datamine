<h3>Important Note: Refunds for purchases described in this Refund Policy are one-time refunds only, unless we explicitly state otherwise in this Policy. This means that you are only eligible for one refund under each purchase category. For example, if you have previously received a refund for Nitro subscription, you will not be eligible for a Nitro subscription refund in the future. </h3>
