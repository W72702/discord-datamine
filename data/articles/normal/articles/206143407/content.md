<p>Want to prevent outsiders from being able to view all the channels on your server? If so, you're in the right place as this article covers the steps for setting up a "private" server.</p>
<p>Setting up a "private" server will restrict access to your server and channels to only the members you specify.</p>
<p>We'll walk you through the four steps below!</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#h_01F48BFNGC0RMJS6DSPQFMH9ZW" target="_self">Disable all permissions for @everyone</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h_01F48BFTPH4J1Q17YF9NXFNN2M" target="_self">Create a new role in the server</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h_01F48BG3BJZPA4XMCRXA1CXYEQ" target="_self">Enable permissions for the role</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h_01F48BG8HJRTWMNW8VFS5SHDRX" target="_self">Assign the role to your server members</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01F48BFNGC0RMJS6DSPQFMH9ZW"><strong>1. Disable all permission for @everyone</strong></h2>
<p>Firstly, you'll want to disable all permissions for <strong>@everyone</strong> using these steps below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Head into the <strong>Roles</strong> tab in your <strong>Server Settings</strong> menu</li>
    <li>Select the default <strong>@everyone</strong> role and then scroll all the way to the bottom of the permissions page</li>
    <li>Once you scroll all the way down, you'll be able to click on the <strong>Clear Role Permissions</strong> button!
        <ul>
            <li>This <strong>Clear Role Permissions</strong> button will automatically disable all toggles for all permissions (which is exactly what we want)!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Last but not least, make sure to save your changes!</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Note: The <em>Discord mobile client</em> does not have the <strong>Clear Role Permissions</strong> button so you would need to manually uncheck each of the permission boxes if you're on mobile. </h3>
<h2 id="h_01F48BFTPH4J1Q17YF9NXFNN2M"><strong>2. Create a new role in the server</strong></h2>
<p>Within this same Roles tab in the Server Settings, create a new role by clicking on the '+' symbol.</p>
<p>Once clicked, you can then type your preferred role name in the box under <strong>Role Name </strong>and then select the color you'd like for the role to appear in the server!</p>

<h2 id="h_01F48BG3BJZPA4XMCRXA1CXYEQ"><strong>3. Enable permissions for your new role</strong></h2>
<p>Enable permissions for your new role by selecting the role and then selecting the permission check boxes you want activated for the role - just make sure to scroll down the role permission list to review all permissions. </p>
<p>When you have finished enabling the right permission, make sure to save your changes!</p>
<ul>
    <li>In this example below, we've started by enabling <strong>View Channels</strong> and <strong>Manage Emojis </strong>and after scrolling down the permission list, you'll see we've also enabled the <strong>Send Messages </strong>and <strong>Attach Files</strong> permissions to the new role.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01F48BG8HJRTWMNW8VFS5SHDRX"><strong>4. Assign the new role to your server members</strong></h2>
<p>After saving the permission changes, you can assign your new role to all members who should have access by selecting the <strong>Members</strong> tab in your <strong>Server Settings</strong> menu.</p>
<p>Within the Members tab, you can directly add the role to the appropriate members by selecting the '+' and then selecting the role name that appears.</p>

<h1>And that's it! </h1>
<p>Now you have a "private" server. When you invite new members to the server, you will need to give them a role before they're able to participate in the channels. </p>
