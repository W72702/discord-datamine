                        <p>This server allows Discord to chat with admins, moderators, content creators, and server owners who manage a server with <strong>Community Settings</strong> enabled. </p>
                        <p>Here you can learn more about features, use best practices, and meet other members who want to improve their communities!</p>
                        <h1 id="docs-internal-guid-d3c0c919-7fff-4fea-6808-4b05e169aa28">JOIN THE DISCORD ADMINS SERVER</h1>
                        <p><strong>What are the requirements to join this space?</strong></p>
                        <p>Below are the requirements your server will have to meet. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have at least 1,000 members on your server</li>
                            <li>Have at least a 60% monthly member retention rate</li>
                            <li>Your server must be at least 3 months old</li>
                            <li>Enable <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Settings</a> on your server</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If your server meets the above requirements and you have the <strong>Manage Server</strong> permission on that server, you will be able to join the Discord Admins server. <br><br>You, as an individual, can join as long as you have the "Manage Server" permission natively in Discord. If you would like other admins or moderators from your server to join the community, you will have to temporarily grant them the <strong>Manage Server</strong> permission in order to see the join button.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: What can I find in the Discord Admins server?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: The Discord Admins server primarily focuses on engaging, managing, protecting, and growing thriving communities on Discord.</p>
                        <p>Here you can find chatter about best practices, safety, apps, monetization, and more. Members will also receive updates on new features or updates directly from Discord. We also use the community as a way to gather feedback on some features and ask members to provide us with feedback.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q: Where can I find the rules for the server?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Current rules can be found in the #rules channel. Be sure to read them completely!</p>
                        <p>However, Discord reserves the right to act on misbehavior and violations not explicitly listed in our rules. At all times, use common sense and good judgment for anything you do on the server. Moderation actions by Staff or Moderators will ensure that we continue to promote healthy communities and assume that all Admins will be acting with positive intent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q: I'm in the server, but I can't see any channels! What should I do?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: You must complete our Community Onboarding to access channels in the server. If you are still struggling with this, you can message our Modmail bot and ask a moderator for assistance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q: Manage Server is a pretty high permission to give out, why is it locked behind this?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: We want to ensure that we are reaching server owners, admins and moderators with this community. As such, this will require us to ensure we are reaching an audience that has this permission or capability in order to create a welcoming and fun community for all.</p>
