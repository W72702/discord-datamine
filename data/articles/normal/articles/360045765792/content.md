<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the steps to take if you do not recognize charges made on Discord:</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a charge from Discord I don't recognize</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure the charge comes from Discord. All purchases made within Discord will be labeled <strong>DISCORD*ItemName</strong> within credit/debit card statements depending on how your bank renders this and PAYPAL DISCORD if completed through PayPal.</span></p>
<p><strong>Please double check these common issues first:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charge is from a family member or friend</span></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030834111" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pending charges</span></a></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charge is associated with an alternate Discord account</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charge came from a renewal or a trial</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you still do not recognize the charge(s), please contact our billing team by creating a ticket <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000118612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and select <strong>Unauthorized Transaction.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strongly encourage you to let our billing team investigate prior to disputing, as we may be unable to refund charges if a dispute has already been initiated.</span></p>
