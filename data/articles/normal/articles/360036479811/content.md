<h1 id="h_01H06JTYPQ72CV5X1F3PQAX318"><strong>Adding a Custom Emoji</strong></h1>
<p>Every server by default can add up to 50 custom emojis that any active server members can use within the server. If any user is a Nitro subscriber, theyâ€™ll be able to use the custom emojis from any server anywhere in Discord where emojis can be used!</p>
<h2 id="h_01H06JV5WS2ASPHNZPTP665XX5">How to upload custom emojis</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To upload custom emojis, choose the server where you would like to add custom emojis.</li>
    <li>Then, head into your <strong>Server Settings</strong> by selecting the drop-down menu located next to the server name.Â </li>
    <li>Once redirected, choose the <strong>Emoji </strong>tab to and press <strong>Upload Emoji</strong> to upload a custom emoji.Â </li>

<p><strong>Keep in mind:Â </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Emoji names must be at least 2 characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores</li>
    <li>Emojis must be under 256KB in size</li>
</ul>
<h3>Any user who is an active member of a server is able to use all uploaded custom emoji within that server, and any users who have a Nitro subscription will be able to use the serverâ€™s custom emojis anywhere on Discord where emojis can be used.</h3>
<h2 id="h_01H06JVDAV2VKZBTRGJDY8NBV7"><strong>Animated Custom Emojis</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to the 50 static custom emojis, if you have<a href="https://discord.com/nitro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Nitro or Nitro Basic</a> you'll have an extra 50 slots available for animated ones too! Sometimes, just typing out ðŸ˜“ ðŸ˜¤ isn't enough to fully express your final exam grind (which btw, you're going to ace). With animated custom emojis, Nelly feels the heat too.Â </p>

<h3><strong>Note: The same naming and sizing requirements listed above apply to the animated custom emojis.</strong></h3>
<h1 id="h_01H06JVMN4EZ3D0DNGF544N425">Twitch Sub Emotes</h1>
<p>Subbed to some of your favorite streamers on Twitch? If the streamer has enabled their Twitch emotes for subs, you can use their custom emojis globally!Â </p>
<h3><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Although animated Twitch emotes will sync into your server, they will be static-only. If you would like to add animated Twitch emotes to your server, you will have to upload them manually.Â </span></h3>
<p>For this to work, you'll need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212112068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sync your Twitch account with Discord</a></li>
    <li>Make sure you're currently subscribed to their channel</li>
    <li>Join the streamer's sub-enabled server</li>
</ul>
