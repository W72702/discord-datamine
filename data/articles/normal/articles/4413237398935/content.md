<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4413255685527/Discord_Partnership_Guidelines_Banner.png" alt="Discord_Partnership_Guidelines_Banner.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord was designed to bring people together. It is our hope that users on our platform are able to meaningfully connect with others around common interests. Partnerships with individuals, organizations, or brands can greatly assist our effort to create belonging based on the partners our users care about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect those partners and our revenue sources to meet the standards of our values, specifically integrity, impact, and compassion, and policies, such as our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. We created this policy to articulate what kinds of partnerships we prohibit, consideration we will have when partnering, and ways to mitigate issues that may arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners are companies/entities that our community, talent, BD, branded communities teams directly engage with to support them in the creation or maintenance of a server on our platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, </span><strong>Discord prohibits partners who</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistent with our Policies:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target those under 13 years of age.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infringe on someone else’s copyright, trademark, or intellectual property. </span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage or attempt to engage in any transaction involving controlled or regulated substances</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote gambling, especially to minors.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct harmful off-platform behaviors related to credible violent extremism, violent threats, and child abuse.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote hate speech or hateful conduct.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share violence and gore with the intent to harass or shock non-consensually.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistent with our Values: </span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote pharmaceutical products or specific healthcare services, such as diet products.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread misinformation around COVID-19, vaccines, climate change denial, or election information.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share or focus on sexually explicit content.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct illegal or unethical business practices.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote the sale, exchange, or building of weapons and weapon accessories. </span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional considerations for partnership, such as a partners’ commitments to <strong>diversity, equity, &amp; inclusion, human rights, and sustainability,</strong> are included. Policy also suggested <strong>mitigations</strong> of potentially prohibiting content for account managers to get their partners to compliance. </span></p>
<h1>Our Values</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Values are quite simply the behaviors that we value in ourselves and the partners we would with. These are the fundamental truths that we hold which guide our decision making and behavior in all our work, especially with the brands, organizations, individuals, and causes we associate ourselves to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">values</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we hold ourselves to are integrity, collaboration, excellence, impact, speed, transparency, and compassion. Of our values, we will focus on ensuring partners have </span><strong>integrity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have a positive </span><strong>impact</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are </span><strong>compassionate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Integrity: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness.</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have always believed that being honest, honoring commitments, and doing what's morally right in the long run is the best way to live life, even when it's painful in the short term.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Impact: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect or influence of one person, thing, or action, on another</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want our time on this Earth to mean something. We want to contribute to improving the human condition, and be a force for good by doing something that leaves the world a little bit better than we found it. This means a relentless focus on what is true, what matters, and building value over time through compounding leverage.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Compassion: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empathy and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all human and with that comes all the challenges and tribulations of life. Work takes up a lot of time for most of us, but is it not the entirety of our experiences. In order to show up and give our mission its all, people need to be able to be themselves - both on good days and bad. Let's not force people to be half of themselves. Instead, let's be mindful and supportive of each other, knowing that we all are striving to do the best for ourselves, our families, our company, and our communities.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Considerations</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will also consider the following dimensions when assessing an individual, organization, or brand to partner. Many of these considerations align closely to our values and would boost the benefit of such a partnership. However,</span><strong> they are not requirements or blockers to partnerships</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will review the following:</span></p>

<h1>Mitigations</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When working with a partner who may have content, products, or audiences that may touch upon any of the prohibited content, account managers can build in mitigations to prevent prohibits content or actions , such as:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enact </span><strong>age-gates</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for servers and channels. </span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure the server is </span><strong>age appropriate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the youngest user they plan to target.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enact </span><strong>notices</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the types of content or audiences expected in the server or event. Notices include:</span>

    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Enforcement</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an account manager reviews a partner or contract, they must review this policy to see if the partner is in compliance. If a partner represents or produces content that is prohibited without necessary mitigations, we will not partner with that individual, organization, or brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an account manager feels there are potential ways to get into compliance with the policy, they can escalate information about the partner and potential mitigations to </span><a href="mailto:policy@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy@discord.com</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h1>Escalations</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a question about whether a partner is in compliance with this policy, mitigations, or any other question, please email <a href="mailto:policy@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy@discord.com</a>. We will review your question based on the policy and may consult with IDP, Legal, and other policy partners.</span></p>
