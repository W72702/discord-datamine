<p>Voice Messages give you the ability to send an audio recording directly to your friends. For now, you can only send Voice Messages through a direct message, group direct message, or in a server with fewer than 200 members. These can be listened to on any device where you can access Discord, but can only be sent through the mobile app. </p>
