<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of<strong> May 28th, 2020</strong>, it has come to our attention that Screen Readers on Discord are no longer able to expand the Server List with the “<em>Enter</em>” key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, this has caused issues for accessing servers further up or down on the list (with the function currently only interacting with the link for the server).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to an update made by NVDA (<em>introduced in NVDA 2020.1) </em>which affected our tree view for the Server List, this particular behavior of the special function tied to the "<em>Enter</em>" key was removed.<br><br>This means the "<em>Enter</em>" key no longer functions as a switch into “Focus Mode” when looking at a tree view.<br><br><strong>The key has now defaulted to the common key bind for interacting with the tree list: “<em>insert+spacebar</em>”.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are curious about NVDA or their changes, you can learn more about the open source screen reader technology here: <a class="anchor-3Z-8Bb anchorUnderlineOnHover-2ESHQB" tabindex="0" title="https://www.nvaccess.org/" href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.nvaccess.org/</a></span></h3>
