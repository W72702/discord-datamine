<h1>What is a Provisional Push Notification?</h1>
<p>Provisional Push Notifications are a type of notification where apps can <span data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">silently</span> push notifications to users (without sound or banner). They show up in the notification center.</p>

<h3>Note: <br>- Only users that have opted into Discord notifications or have <span data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">not opted out</span> can see a provisional notification from us. <br>- Some opt-in users can choose to turn their direct push notifications into silent provisional ones via iOS' notification center settings.</h3>
<h2>What do we mean by not opted out?</h2>
<p>During the iOS onboarding process, you may have selected "Maybe Later" and so are in a middle state of neither opt-in nor opt-out when it comes to notifications from Discord.</p>
