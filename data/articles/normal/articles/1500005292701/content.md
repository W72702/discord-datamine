<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Our </span><a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> require that all adult content posted to Discord be kept behind an age-restricted gate. Server owners can designate </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific channels as being 18+</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> by adding an age-restricted gate. Entire servers can now be classified as 18+ through the use of an </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age-restricted server designation</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Servers must be classified as age-restricted if the community is organized around age-restricted themes or if the majority of the server’s content is focused on 18+ content.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01H4RH13HQJNMSFPDA9KGDVJB5"><strong><span style="color: #ae6607;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">I can’t view or join Age-Restricted servers. What should I do?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you will not be able to join or view the content in age-restricted servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">For people aged 18 and older, age-restricted servers can only be joined on desktop or Android devices. Those with iOS devices are required to "opt-in on desktop" in order to view age-restricted servers from their iOS device.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">How to opt in for iOS:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Sign in to Discord on desktop and navigate to your User Settings. You can find your User Settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner of the app.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">In the User Settings menu, click on Privacy &amp; Safety.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Find “Allow access to age-restricted content on iOS” and click the toggle. This will let you view age-restricted servers you are already a member of from your iOS device.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Additionally, a subset of age-restricted servers that are specifically focused on explicit pornographic content will be blocked entirely on iOS. </span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">iOS users aged 18+ will only be able to join and access these dedicated pornography servers on the desktop and web versions of Discord.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #104c32;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Note: Only age-restricted server owners and moderators will be allowed to view and manage this specific subset of age-restricted servers on iOS.</span></strong></h3>
<h2 id="h_01H4RH1GSQF4689C1VVX9CGHGV"><strong><span style="color: #ae6607;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">How do I update my age information?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If you are over the age of 18 and have been locked out of an age-restricted server, you can appeal by following the instructions below: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Step 1: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Take a photo of yourself holding the following items. Your face and all of the required information needs to be visible and readable in ONE photo.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">A photo ID that contains your date of birth, clearly readable</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">A piece of paper that shows your full Discord Username</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Step 2: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Once you have taken the photo, submit a request to the Trust &amp; Safety team here:</span><a href="https://dis.gd/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/request</a><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> and select "Appeals, age update, other questions" under the </span><em><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Report Type</span></em><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> option.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Be sure to use the email address associated with your Discord account. Our Trust &amp; Safety team needs to receive the request directly from the email address associated with the Discord account to protect our users' privacy and security.</span></p>
