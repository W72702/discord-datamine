<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord has become a place to call home to over 150 million people around the world to talk about everything from sneakers, </span><a href="https://blog.discord.com/inside-8-bit-music-theorys-growing-video-game-soundtrack-server-fa33cdf2dee2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the deepest details of their favorite game soundtrack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV_QsJfokpY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual car meetups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and late-night study sessions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.discord.com/your-place-to-talk-a7ffa19b901b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just under a year ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we outlined the work we’ve done to welcome the world to Discord, no matter what your interests may be. To help, we also wanted to make our overall look and feel just as welcoming to the world as the ever-improving in-app experience and help everyone enjoy Discord just a bit more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, welcome to Discord. Again. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s Get Right Into It… *Why* Would We Change Our Logo?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current logo has stuck around with us since the beginning of time itself… as in, since we first launched Discord in 2015. A lot of people aren’t aware that the little smiley icon in the Discord logo has a name: Clyde. Most people call him Discord, Mickey Mouse pants, a game controller, and of course, ugly. :(</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317842/Rebrand_Blog__1_.png" alt="Rebrand_Blog__1_.png"></p>
<h4 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">
    <span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small" style="font-weight: 400;">OG Clyde, hiding in his little bubble he calls home.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span>
</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, you’ll see old Clyde within a rounded rectangle chat bubble. Technically, being inside this bubble is Clyde’s “home.” Whether it’s on our website, within a profile icon on our social pages, or inside the app icon on your computer or mobile device, Clyde was always “in” something, like a hamster stuck in a rolling ball. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the most eagle-eyed may notice, but the old logo was horizontally asymmetrical —  something our Design Team’s been waiting years to fix. Small details such as “Clyde lives within a bubble” and “not symmetrical” can be deceivingly restrictive when creating new interface elements, art assets, and even merch items.  </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317862/Rebrand_Blog__2_.jpg" alt="Rebrand_Blog__2_.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we took a step back and thought to ourselves: How can we give Clyde a refresh without going too crazy? And what makes Clyde, well… Clyde? It took a while for us to land in a good place — people around the world are already familiar with the Discord logo, so we can’t have them wake up one day seeing something weird like a banana as our icon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a preview of all the ideas and experimentation we went through when determining how Clyde should look. We went from lots of circular shapes to what’s basically a :) and eventually refining the more squared-off shape that you’re seeing today. </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317902/Rebrand_Blog__3_.gif" alt="Rebrand_Blog__3_.gif"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also freed Clyde from being stuck in his bubble, and he’s very excited about it. In fact, you might even see Clyde smile. Or be a bit sad. Or sleepy. A good amount of fan art depicts Clyde with expressions, but now we’re officially letting Clyde feel what he needs to feel. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317882/Rebrand_Blog__4_.png" alt="Rebrand_Blog__4_.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take a peek at the top of Clyde’s head, you may notice the old antennas look a bit more like shoulders now. We realized that sharp little antennas didn't translate well when printed on different types of materials, or when printed on really small surfaces such as a pin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, we believe changes to Clyde present him in a more friendly tone, reshaped to be more understandable whether smaller or larger, all while still keeping our pal looking unique and familiar to the most veteran of users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015632001/Rebrand_Blog__5_.gif" alt="Rebrand_Blog__5_.gif"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these smaller details, improvements, and new options that add up to a fresh new look for years to come. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making Our Mark: The New Wordmark</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the refreshed Clyde, you’ll also see an updated the Discord wordmark, which is a fancy way of saying “the font used to spell out ‘Discord’” — it’s a custom font based upon “Ginto” that we created to go with the new Clyde logo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We explored hundreds of different fonts before landing on this very unique font face that we believe captures the playfulness of Discord. We even tweaked some elements of the font and letters so it’s easier to read than how it originally was.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631901/Rebrand_Blog__6_.png" alt="Rebrand_Blog__6_.png"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing that we debated, changed, changed back, changed back again, agonized over and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">might</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have even had serious anxiety about was whether we should keep the wordmark in all caps or in title case. Once something is finalized and the world sees, there’s no going back, and that includes how things are capitalized.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, we decided that Title case — making sure it’s always capitalized like someone’s name — made our new wordmark more legible. Although you won't often see the wordmark used on its own, it does look beautiful.</span></p>
<h2>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shades of Deep Blurple (And Other Colors)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good ol’ Blurple: Just like Clyde, Blurple is in every corner of Discord. It’s not exactly blue, not exactly purple... but it’s definitely close to our hearts. All of our older colors were a bit on the pastel-y side, along with our cleverly-named shades of Grey including… “Greyple,” “Dark, but not black” and “Not quite black.” </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new logo comes a brighter, more saturated Blurple: <strong>below is our new Blurple, right alongside the new Clyde and our new wordmark so you can cohesively see the new look</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631881/Brand_Refresh_Blog_Header_1.gif" alt="Brand_Refresh_Blog_Header_1.gif"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internally, we first used this new color “blurple_5_plus_adjustments,” but that didn’t quite roll off the tongue as well as Blurple did. The lighter color of Blurple will forever be known as “OG Blurple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to bring more energy to Discord for our entire color palette by brightening up the colors to be more bold and playful. Along with refining many of the existing colors with a brighter hue, we’re bringing a bit more variety to the color palette by introducing a new color: Red.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631921/Rebrand_Blog__8_.gif" alt="Rebrand_Blog__8_.gif"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might recognize some of these colors — they’re inspired by application features that you’re likely familiar with on Discord, such as Online, Away, and Do Not Disturb status messages. And while pink isn’t a direct correlation to an in-app color, it’s as equally playful and fun as the rest of ‘em. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bit more lively. A little bit brighter. And hopefully, a bit more like home. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015317922/Rebrand_Blog__9_.png" alt="Rebrand_Blog__9_.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see the entire set of new colors over at <a href="https://discord.com/branding" target="_self">discord.com/branding</a>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How This Affects Using Discord </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we say our new palette is inspired by using Discord on the day-to-day, that doesn’t mean these colors are strictly for our website or blog. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open up Discord next time, things might feel a bit brighter. We’ve got our logos and colors, along with some new typography and art on the login and registration pages.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you're logged in, the changes will be more subtle. New Clyde will be welcoming you on the top-left, just as he always has, and all the colors will be just a bit bolder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015631961/Rebrand_Blog__10_.png" alt="Rebrand_Blog__10_.png"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New typography will appear within certain headings throughout the app, but the majority of the headings and fonts will stay the same as they are today. As the year goes on, you may notice additional updates here and there, such as changes to illustrations in empty states and tooltips — we want to make sure they’re perfect first.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Did The Community Help Out with These Changes?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord has become a place for millions around the world to </span><a href="https://blog.discord.com/discord-is-where-creativity-shines-f64a659aa5b6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create art</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to karaoke nights and </span><a href="https://blog.discord.com/celebrating-earth-day-across-the-planet-ca170d0037ec"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharing plant care tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, speculate about cryptocurrencies, and on occasion, accidentally fall asleep because you’ve been up too late on voice. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When figuring out our new styles, we connected with over 26,000 members of the community to ask what Discord means to them. We got your feedback and direction on style, colors, and even some of the in-app phrasing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500015632041/Rebrand_Blog__11__15fps.gif" alt="Rebrand_Blog__11__15fps.gif"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your feedback and guidance also helped us make sure our new colors are still readable in both Dark and Light themes. Because of this, you may notice that our in-app colors don’t perfectly match the ones you see in our marketing — we'll continue to fine-tune them as time goes on.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s your influence that helped guide us while making changes both big and small, and we’re so grateful to have such dedicated and creative members of our community. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a Place Millions Call Home</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re super excited (</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and just a tiny bit nervous</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to unveil our new look today, on our 6th birthday. Around all our websites and social profiles, you’ll see a new phrase: </span><strong>Imagine a Place</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a Place is our new mantra that brings to life the fact that Discord means so many different things to so many people around the world.
