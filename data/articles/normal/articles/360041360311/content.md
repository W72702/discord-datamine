<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You‚Äôve been telling us stories of how you‚Äôre using Discord in all sorts of amazing ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We‚Äôve seen classrooms come together, workers without an office find a new place to connect, and tons of surprising uses. To help out where we can, we recently </span><a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/helping-out-where-we-can-3a5fb7bac77a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we‚Äôre temporarily raising the user limit on Go Live from 10 to 50 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons we made this change was to help teachers. With high schools and college campuses closing in many parts of the world, more and more of them are turning to Discord to make sure their students don‚Äôt fall behind and can continue to learn. And we‚Äôve been flooded with requests from educators asking: What can I do with Discord?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it briefly, Discord offers:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dedicated, free to use, invite only class space for classes like AP US History</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text channels to organize things like lessons, homework, or study groups so students can go over the latest Pre-Calculus assignments together</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice channels for both one-to-one and group discussions, or even office hours</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A real-time teaching environment where lessons can be shared with up to 50 people at a time</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre an educator, you might be new to Discord. We created a fast, one-click way to get you started.</span><strong> Just </strong><a href="https://discordapp.com/template/fVfBazbqjhXg"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong> and you‚Äôll breeze through the Discord signup and automatically get your own pre-organized classroom space.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôve also pulled together an overview of how to use Discord for online learning. Please note that the minimum age to join Discord is 13, so younger students won‚Äôt be able to use the service.</span></p>
<h1><strong>Discord 101</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can download and sign up for Discord for free on </span><a href="https://discordapp.com/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">desktop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord/id985746746"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or via your </span><a href="https://discordapp.com/register"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web browser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here‚Äôs a quick feature rundown:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord is made up of invite only spaces known as </span><strong>servers </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äî think of your server as your classroom.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Servers are organized into individual </span><strong>channels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you‚Äôll interact with students or other teachers.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are </span><a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034632292"><strong>text channels</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where anyone can post messages, upload files, and share images for others to read at any time.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">And also </span><strong>voice channels, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">where teachers can conduct classes with Go Live, and students can get together to talk and collaborate.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, you can get going quickly by using this simple </span><a href="https://discordapp.com/template/fVfBazbqjhXg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will give you a server that looks and feels like this:</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can customize and organize your Discord created from this template however you like. Change the server name, channel names, and organize your students with powerful roles. Once you‚Äôve got your server set up as you want, it‚Äôs time to invite your students to join you!</span></p>

<h1><strong>Conducting class remotely</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord‚Äôs </span><a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151#h_65fe911c-66b2-4efc-ad5c-15caf2c8ae3f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature allows you to teach a class for as many as 50 people, regardless of where they are. Students don‚Äôt see you, they only see what you‚Äôre sharing on your computer. As you present, you can take questions and call on students just as you would in a traditional classroom. The session can‚Äôt be accessed by anyone outside the server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get started, join a voice channel (click the üîàsymbol), then click the¬†<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360052894251/desktop-computer_1f5a5.png" alt="desktop-computer_1f5a5.png" width="16" height="16"> icon in the voice status panel near the bottom left corner and a new window will pop out. Just pick the application window or screen you want to share, press the ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù button, and you‚Äôre sharing with students.</span></p>
