<h1>What is this Temporary Hold?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may place a temporary hold for a small amount (less than one U.S. dollar) on your payment method when you make a purchase or activate a trial/promotion subscription. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method. We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method. </span></p>
<h3>
    <strong>Note: </strong>Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.
</h3>
<h2>What if I still see a Charge on my account or payment method? </h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank should release the hold in a matter of days after we reverse the charge. If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at</span><a href="https://dis.gd/contact"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</span></p>
<h2>I see a  "Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption" error when trying to redeem my promo link.</h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">If you're seeing a "Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. <br></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</span></p>
