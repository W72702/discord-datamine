<p>Once Spotify has been connected to a Discord account, what someone is listening to can be seen on both the mini and full profile (if enabled). </p>

<h3><span style="color: #104c32;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">For friends to listen along, they'll need to have Spotify Premium or they'll receive an error.</span></h3>
<p>Not only can you invite your friends to listen to your music, but you can also join them and listen to theirs!</p>
<p>While Spotify is playing, click the + in your text box to invite your friend(s) to listen with you. You can send this either through a Direct Message, Group Direct Message, or even through a specific channel.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14121706574231" alt="spotify_listen_along_dm.jpg"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14121735432855" alt="spotify_listen_along.jpg"></span><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">  </span></p>
<p>You'll get a Message Preview of your invite, and you'll be able to add a comment before sending it.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14121708156951" alt="spotify_share.png"></p>
<p>After sending the invite, your friends will be able to click Join and listen to your sweet tunes with you.</p>
<p>The invite link is also dynamic and will change when you change songs. The invite will show the session has ended if you stop your music and will update again when you resume playing!</p>
<p>You'll be able to see what friends are listening with you on the bottom left of your app:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14121738173719" alt="spotify_listeners.png"></p>
<p>And that’s it! Enjoy sharing and listening to sweet tunes with your friends.</p>
