<p>Slash Commands are here! No more guessing how commands work or trying to figure out which ID goes where. Slash Commands are here to make your life a whole lot easier.</p>
<h1>WHAT ARE SLASH COMMANDS?</h1>
<p>Slash Commands are the new, exciting way to build and interact with bots on Discord. With Slash Commands, all you have to do is typeÂ <code>/</code> and you're ready to use your favorite bot. You can easily see all the commands a bot has, and validation and error handling help you get the command right the first time.</p>
<p>Not every bot might be using Slash Commands right now. They're brand new, and it'll take some time for developers to start using them. So, be patient, but get excited!</p>
<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
<p>We've all used a <code>!help</code> command and then received a wall of text in response. Now, instead of having to google a bot's commands or look through that long <code>!help</code> answer, you can see all the commands a bot has to offer just by typing <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>This command list will filter commands as you type, making it easy to browse commands or find exactly what you're looking for. You quick typers out there can also use <code>TAB</code> and <code>ENTER</code> to quickly choose and navigate through commands.</p>
<h1>AUTOCOMPLETE</h1>
<p>For certain values in Slash Commands, we'll help you out with a handy autocomplete! No more needing to remember ids. If you need to pick a user, a role, or a channel, you can use the autocomplete that you know and love to help.</p>

<h1>VALIDATION AND ERROR HANDLING</h1>
<p>Slash Commands help you learn how to use bots without the awkward mistakes of typing the wrong command into chat, or typing it the wrong way. If you accidentally pick an invalid option, we'll let you know before it sends:</p>

<h1>NEW PERMISSIONS</h1>

<p>Slash Commands are powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility. So, we've added a new "Use Slash Commands" permission to help keep your server organized. You can turn off Slash Commands for your entire server or for a specific channel by changing that permission.</p>
<p>The "Use Slash Commands" permission only affects commands created by bots. "Built-in" commands like <code>/giphy</code>, <code>/nick</code>, and <code>/me</code> will be unaffected.</p>
<h1>HOW DO I MAKE SLASH COMMANDS?</h1>
<p>If you want to try your hand at making custom Slash Commands, check out our <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands" target="_self">documentation.</a> Slash Commands can be integrated into your existing bot, or you can make something entirely new!</p>
