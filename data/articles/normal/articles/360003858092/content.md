<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are compliant with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and updated our privacy policy in early May to be compliant with. Although these changes were spurred by European law, we think privacy is super important and so those changes apply to everyone, no matter where you're located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a quick summary:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t asking to collect more data or use your personal data differently — instead, we’re being more specific on how we use the information we collect, how long we keep that data, and the rights you have regarding it.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of that, we’re also adding information about how you can control the usage of your personal data and download the data that you’ve provided to us.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we’re providing more clarity around the legal bases we use to process your information, including providing the service to you, complying with the law, improving our services, fighting abuse on the system, and developing new features for you.</span></li>
