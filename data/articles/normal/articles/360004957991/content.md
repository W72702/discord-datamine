<p>This information can be pretty tricky to traverse, so we wanted to give you the low down on what is in your Discord Data Package. We also wanted to let you know how we use it, so if JSON and CSV files are spooky - don't fret! We're here to help.</p>
<h1>What's Inside?</h1>
<p><strong>Your Account</strong>: Your friends list, settings, username, email, avatar, connected accounts and any transaction history for Nitro. If you have created any developer applications, this will be included as well.<br><strong>Your Servers</strong>: Servers you’ve joined. If you own a server, it will also include that server’s icon, settings, roles, permissions, channels, audit log, and any custom emoji attached to it.  <br><strong>Your Messages</strong>: All messages you have sent in servers, DMs or group DMs, unless it has been deleted manually by you or someone else. This folder will also include links to attachments uploaded.<br><strong>Your Activity</strong>: Info about how you navigate the app, the times you used Discord, what games you played, and what servers you hung out in. We use this to improve Discord and tailor it to you.<br><strong>Your Programs</strong>: Any applications you have submitted for HypeSquad, Server Verification, the Partners Program, and other cool stuff.</p>

<h1>Why do we need this data?</h1>
<p>The ultimate function behind all of this data is to help Discord run. You do have the ability to update your <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004109911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Settings</a>, but a good example of what this information does is help power features like the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001580091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Games Tab</a>. Let's look into what each folder of your Data Package contains.</p>
<h3>Note: JSON files can be opened easily in Notepad, or you can drag and drop them into a browser like Chrome or Firefox. CSV files can easily be opened in Excel, or Google Sheets.</h3>
<h2>Account</h2>
<p>The account folder contains a couple different items. The first is the avatar that you are using. The second is a JSON file which contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whether you allow e-mail notifications.</li>
    <li>Your Games Tab settings. (Users you subscribe to, Users you opt-out of including.)</li>
    <li>Your IP Address.</li>
    <li>Any accounts you have connected to Discord. (Twitch, Twitter, Steam, etc.) </li>

</ul>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>The activity folder contains four folders, each with a JSON file that has information about the actions you have taken on Discord. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytics - This is a record of some of your actions within Discord. The information is used to improve your Discord experience.
        <ul>
            <li>You can disable tracking analytics here: <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety &gt; Turn Off 'Use data to improve Discord' </strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Modeling - This is data we use to better tailor certain parts of Discord to you, like the Games Tab.
        <ul>
            <li>You can disable this here: <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety &gt; Turn Off 'Use data to customize my Discord experience'</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reporting - This folder contains a JSON file with data we use in order to operate our business. (Information such as messages sent, or your Nitro subscription, as an example.)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Messages</h2>
<p>The messages folder contains all the messages that you have sent on Discord. These are broken down separately into folders based on Direct Messages, Group Direct Messages, and Channels that you have chatted in. The number for each folder is the Channel ID for where the messages were sent. There is a JSON file which also contains a full list of the folders included.</p>
<p>When you select a folder, you'll notice it contains a couple items. The first is a JSON file which will include information about what is contained; Guild ID, Channel ID, and Channel Name if it is a file containing messages from a server. The Channel ID, and User IDs if it is a file containing messages from a DM or Group DM.</p>
<p>The second is a CSV file which contains the transcript of your messages. It is made up of four different columns</p>
<ul>
    <li>ID - The message ID</li>
    <li>Timestamp - The date and exact time your message was sent.</li>
    <li>Contents - Your message.</li>
    <li>Attachments - A CDN link to any images, or files you included in your message.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note: If you manually delete a message - it is no longer stored in Discord and therefore will not be included in your Data Package.</h3>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>The programs folder will give you a quick breakdown of our different community programs. The JSON folder included here has information on any applications sent for the Partners Program, HypeSquad Program and Verified Server Program.</p>

</ul>
<p>The information included will vary based on what you provide, and which programs you have applied for.</p>
<h3>Note: The programs folder contains information that you provided through the website when applying to the HypeSquad, Partner or Verified Server Programs. If you have not applied for any of our programs this will be empty.</h3>
<h2>Servers</h2>
<p>The servers folder contains information for all of the servers that you are a member of. This includes servers that you own. The information provided for each is a little different. There is a JSON file which also contains a full list of the folders included.</p>
