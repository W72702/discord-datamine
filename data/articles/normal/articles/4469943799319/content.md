<p>We take your privacy seriously, and we’re constantly evaluating best practices. Below you’ll find a summary of the key updates to the <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, but please do read the full policy, as your use of Discord will be subject to the updated policy. The changes go into effect on <strong>March 27, 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s new:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhanced readability.</strong> Like the Terms, we’ve made this easier to understand and used plain language where we can.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clarified privacy rights.</strong> We've also made updates to reflect changes in the law in the U.S. and internationally. For example, we’ve updated our section on user rights so that you can be clear on what those rights are and how to exercise them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Support for payment features. </strong>We added in more specifics on the information needed when you buy or sell something on Discord.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Controls, controls, controls. </strong>We updated our description of how to customize your settings. For example, you can control whether we collect, use, and display information about the games you might be playing.
