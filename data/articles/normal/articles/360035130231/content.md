<p>We're aware of a few known issues when using Discord on <strong>macOS 10.15 Catalina or higher. </strong>Here's how to navigate the island landscape and fix these issues yourself!</p>
<h2>Permissions Confusion</h2>
<p>With the release of Catalina, the <strong>Accessibility</strong> permissions that we rely on to power push-to-talk and other systemwide keybinds have changed a bit. You may be asked to re-authorize Discord when you first launch it! <br><br>If you're on Catalina (or higher) and can't use PTT or other keybinds, make sure to check <strong>System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy</strong> and ensure that Discord still has access to the permissions under <strong>Accessibility</strong> as well as <strong>Input Monitoring</strong>. </p>
<h2>Keybind Trouble</h2>
<p>If you're still unable to set keybinds after enabling those permissions, try the following steps!</p>
<p>1. Open Terminal (command + space type "Terminal")<br>2. Copy/paste <code>tccutil reset All</code> into Terminal<br>3. Press Enter<br>4. Fully close out Discord and reopen </p>
