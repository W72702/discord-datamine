<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">To claim through the Xbox app, you must be a current </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member. Additionally, this promotion is only available in AR, AU, AT, BE, BR, CA, CL, CO, CZ, DK, FI, FR, DE, GR, HK, HU, IN, IE, IL, IT, JP, MX, NL, NZ, NO, PL, PT, SG, SA, ZA, ES, SE, CH, TW, TR, AE, GB, US. <br></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Who can redeem this Nitro trial to their Discord account?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-ee43c4c5-7fff-59fd-1a1e-8cb60d3ed27f">Users who have never had an active Nitro subscription on their Discord accounts are eligible to redeem this Nitro promotion.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, users who previously had a Discord Nitro subscription and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic subscription in the past 12 months are ineligible.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: What if I'm a current or previous Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boost subscriber? Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>If you previously had a Discord Nitro subscription at any point on your accounts and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic subscription in the past 12 months, you are ineligible to redeem this promotion.</p>
<p>If you have had a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting subscription active on your account and you’ve never had a Nitro subscription,  you will be able to redeem this promotion and replace it with the 3 months Nitro subscription.</p>
<h3>
    <strong>HOWEVER, please note:<br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- By choosing to activate this 3 month trial, you will lose any features associated with your current subscriptions, and **</span><strong>you will not receive a refund for any remaining value on your current subscription</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">**.</span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the promotion period, you'll be converted to a paying Nitro subscription unless you cancel your subscription.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01FDVJNNJE5MT233TZE6MYRYTV"><strong>Payment Info and Subscription Questions</strong></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your free 3 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the three months!</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong>To cancel your subscription, follow these steps below:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">First head into your <strong>User Settings</strong></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, click/press the <strong>Subscriptions</strong> tab</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once in the Subscription tab, press the <strong>Cancel</strong> Button (right beside the Switch Plans button)</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will then see a new window pop up, where you will need to press the <strong>Continue</strong> button</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, you will see a message explaining the cancellation details, and you will need to press the <strong>Confirm</strong> button in order to finalize the cancellation of the subscription! </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a </span><strong>temporary hold</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</span></p>
<h3>
    <strong>Note: </strong>Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at</span><a href="https://dis.gd/contact"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Now that the 3 months have passed and I want to activate my subscription, why do I see a different price for Nitro from my friends?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>It's possible that you or your friend have access to our new localized currency pricing for Nitro, Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, and Boosts.</p>
<p>For more information on localized pricing, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407269525911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this article here</a>!</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: What if I don’t see the Nitro promo in the Xbox app, even if I'm an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A: <span style="font-weight: 400;">To claim through the Xbox app, you must be a current </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member.

<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a Sad Trombone error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you happen to be entering this Nitro promo link from the promotion into the Discord Gift Inventory or as a link within Discord chat?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, this is the incorrect method for redeeming the Nitro promo link, and you will see an error when attempting to redeem the promotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to successfully claim this promotion, try opening up an incognito browser and then copy and pasting the promotion link into your browser's address bar (also known as a location bar or URL bar). </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you're seeing an "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro subscription so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on. Or you can give the promotion link to a friend who hasn't had Nitro before!</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've <span id="docs-internal-guid-f4b56de0-7fff-c9b6-c95f-c79d31a78182">previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account</span> and you won't be able to redeem this 3 month perk! However, this promo link can be gifted to a friend!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:</span><a href="https://dis.gd/contact"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "This gift has already been redeemed" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are seeing a "This gift has been redeemed already" error, that means that the Nitro promo link has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've redeemed this promo link on another Discord account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, if you redeemed this promo link using your mobile device, double check the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, once the promo link has been redeemed, the promo link cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue90 wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work." error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the link is invalid! If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link sent to your email!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their email!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</span></p>
