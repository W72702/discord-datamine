<h1 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">What are Discord System Messages?</h1>
<p>Discord System Messages are official messages that we send to alert you of an account issue. These Messages can range from a variety of Payment issues, Support Ticket Updates, and ToS Violation Warnings.</p>
<p>There are few ways to confirm that the message you're receiving is really from Discord:</p>
<p>1. Messages from Discord will always have the "SYSTEM" badge in the member list.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">2. The start of your DM with Discord will have special text informing you that this is an official message.</p>
