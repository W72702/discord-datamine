<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-4ce26cc6-7fff-83c7-f30a-04814fb7264b"><strong>How Does Link Sharing Work?</strong></h2>
<p>There are two types of event sharing links:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Event<strong> Server Invite Links:</strong> these work similar to a server invite link, except it renders a special Event Embed in the Discord app that has event details and a button to RSVP. Users who aren’t in the server will be able to select this invite and join the server.</li>
    <li>Direct<strong> event links:</strong> these operate similar to message links. They will directly link you to the event and will only work if you have permission to see the event. If you’re not in the the server the link will not work.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Note: Only users with Invite Permissions can generate Event Server Invites. Events in private channels cannot generate Event Server invites and will default to Direct event links.</strong></h3>
<h1 id="h_01H2H6RP7CX5VFTE81M8M982NT"><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if an event takes place in a voice channel with restricted access?</strong></p>
<p>A: For events in restricted voice channels, only users with the right role/permissions to that channel can potentially attend the event and see the scheduled event in the <strong>Events </strong>option of the server's channel list.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will this be available on all platforms?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our mobile platforms may take longer to rollout, but will be available across all platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What channels can I schedule events for?</strong></p>
<p>A: At this point in time, events can be scheduled for Private Stages, Voice Channels, and there is a free form field for any additional place (e.g. physical location, text channel, etc) that you are hosting an event.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens when I press on the "Interested" button for an upcoming event?</strong></p>
<p>A: When you press on "Interested" for an event, you'll be letting the event host know that you'd like to attend and you'll also receive a notification when the event is officially live! You can also retract the notification reminder by re-pressing and retracting your interest.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I forget to start my own event (as an event owner/host)?</strong></p>
<p>A: If your event does not start within 8 hours of the scheduled time, our system will automatically remove your event from the list of Scheduled Events for your Community.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why should I even schedule an event?</strong></p>
<p>A: Events essentially provide your Community the opportunity to receive advanced notice for things happening in the server! Community members also receive a notification when the event goes live if they're "Interested" in the event, which helps ensure no one misses it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When do I need to schedule events by?</strong></p>
<p>A: There's no specific time limit to how far in advance an event must be created. As long as the event hasn't yet started, you'll be able to schedule one for your Community!</p>
<p><strong>Q: How many scheduled events can a server have?</strong></p>
<p>A: At this point in time, there's a cap of 100 scheduled events that can take place in a server at one point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What permissions do I need to schedule an event?</strong></p>
<p>A: Events require a specific permission for creating, starting, editing, and deleting. The "<strong>Manage Event</strong>" permission can be enabled by going to <strong>Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Edit Role &gt; Permissions &gt; Manage Event</strong>.</p>
<p>If hosting an event in a Stage Channel, you will need to be a Stage Mod for the channel. If hosting an event in a Voice Chat channel, you can have just the channel-specific Manage Event permission or the server-wide Manage Event permission as well as the other channel-specific permissions, such as View, Speak, and Connect.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can't I share an event?</strong></p>
<p>A: The permissions for sharing events are tied to creating invite links. If a user has permissions to invite other users to the channel, they will also have permissions to share events tied to that channel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does the Event tab show up in my server?</strong></p>
<p>A: For Community servers, the Event tab will always show for users with the “Manage Events” permission. It does not show to anyone else unless there is an upcoming event.</p>
