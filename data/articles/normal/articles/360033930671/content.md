<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having trouble seeing images and other attachments on Discord? Or, are you having trouble downloading or updating our app? There are a few things that could be causing the trouble, and we’re here to help!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial Troubleshooting Steps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first step, </span><strong>please try changing your DNS provider</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNS issues are the most common cause for images being broken and other connection troubles, and changing your DNS provider can potentially lead to faster and safer browsing! </span></p>
<h3>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve got a guide on </span><strong>how to change your DNS provider</strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034366151" target="_self"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034366151-Changing-Your-DNS-Provider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Users</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the UK and your internet service provider is </span><strong>BT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the folks at </span><strong>British Telecom</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have confirmed that their DNS service is blocking images and other parts of our service for some users. </span><strong>BT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has recommended that impacted users change their DNS provider. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Users</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If changing your DNS provider doesn’t do the trick, and your internet service provider is </span><strong>Xfinity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ve become aware that </span><strong>Xfinity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has blocked our image delivery services for users with </span><strong>xFi Routers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who have </span><strong>Private Browsing</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enabled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working with </span><strong>Comcast</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a solution to this issue. In the meantime, we would recommend contacting </span><strong>Xfinity Support </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">for additional help! </span><a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.xfinity.com/support/</span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Regions and ISPs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a DNS provider swap didn’t do the trick, we’re aware that some antivirus and security providers, such as </span><strong>Norton Family </strong>and <strong>Lookout</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have blocked our services in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, please try </span><strong>whitelisting Discord in your antivirus software</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a next step! You may need to contact your antivirus provider for support in whitelisting us.</span></p>
