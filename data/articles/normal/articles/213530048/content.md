<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So your Discord server is growing and you’re now wanting to turn it into a full-fledged Discord Community server? Well, you have come to the right place! Before diving in this article, we recommend checking out the </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/categories/200404378-Server-Setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Setup</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> articles as these cover permissions, setting up channels, and more.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our example, we will be creating a community server called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orchard eSports</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is an eSports organization that has 3 teams (Apple, Cherry, and Lemon).</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GM48W901AMJ7RC0Q8VN885PR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server Roles</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, we are using <em>Orchard eSports</em> community server as our example. Before we start creating channels, let’s create some roles for our members and we’ll go over what each role is for.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910492490391" alt="community_server_roles.jpg"></span></p>
<p><strong>Head Orchard</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Role for someone that is an administrator on the server. With this role they have all edit and manage permissions enabled for the server.</span></p>
<p><strong>Farmhand</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Role for someone that is a moderator on the server. They don’t have the exact same permissions as an admin would (Head Orchard), but they do have some permissions that a regular member would not. For example: ability to delete messages from other members, able to post in the announcement channel, etc.</span></p>
<p><strong>Team Apple Captain</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - This role is for someone that is a Team Captain. Because they are part of a team, they have access to all Team Apple text and voice channels. They can not access the channels for other teams or admin and moderators.</span></p>
<p><strong>Team Cherry Captain</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - This role is for someone that is a Team Captain. Because they are part of a team, they have access to all Team Cherry text and voice channels. They can not access the channels for other teams or admin and moderators.</span></p>
<p><strong>Team Lemon Captain</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - This role is for someone that is a Team Captain. Because they are part of a team, they have access to all Team Lemon text and voice channels. They can not access the channels for other teams or admin and moderators.</span></p>
<p><strong>Team Apple</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - For this role, this is for members of the Team Apple team. They are not able to see other team’s channels but their own.</span></p>
<p><strong>Team Cherry</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - For this role, this is for members of the Team Cherry team. They are not able to see other team’s channels but their own.</span></p>
<p><strong>Team Lemon</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - For this role, this is for members of the Team Lemon team. They are not able to see other team’s channels but their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Member</strong> - This is a general member role for someone that is not on one of the eSports teams, but is a member of the server. They do not have access to any of the team channels or admin and moderator channels, but they do have access to channels like #general that is for everyone.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GM48WF09GZG8K7XZEN3F8TDS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categories</span></h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our example for a community server, <em>Orchard eSports</em> is an eSports organization that has 3 teams (Apple, Cherry, and Lemon). Now that we have roles created, let’s get started on some categories for our text and voice channels to be under. You can even set up permissions to be category-specific, so it applies to all text and voice channels nested inside of the category.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910496643095" alt="community_server_categories.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The categories we have for our server are: Welcome, Team Apple, Team Cherry, Team Lemon, and Voice Channels.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910497712407" alt="advanced_community_category_settings.gif"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want only members of Team Apple to be able to view all of the text channels in that category, we can do so through category permissions. You can do this by right-clicking on the category name and selecting “<strong>Edit Category</strong>”.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910499039383" alt="community_server_categories_private.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under here we want to enable </span><strong>Private Category</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since this is a category only created for a specific team. This means the category will automatically sync the permissions for all text and voice channels under this category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we set it so Team Apple members can view these channels, let’s also make it so other members of the server can not.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910534161431" alt="community_server_categories_view.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With @everyone selected we want to make sure </span><strong>View Channels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is disabled. You can go ahead and also disable all of the other settings, but the main setting we want disabled is </span><strong>View Channels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so not everyone can access these channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s add the role Team Apple and make sure they have certain settings enabled so they can read and message in these channels with their teammates. Here are the settings that we enabled for the role, Team Apple.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910535887127" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_1.jpg"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>View Channel</strong> - This setting is enabled so all team members can view any of the channels under this category.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910562121239" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_2.jpg"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Add Reactions</strong> - This setting is enabled so team members can add reactions to messages. This is great for polls or just seeing the overall sentiment towards something posted.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910539395607" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_3.jpg"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Use External Emoji </strong>- This setting is enabled so team members can use emojis from other servers as long as they have <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord Nitro</a>.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910540609943" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_4.jpg"></span></p>
<p><strong>Read Message History</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - This setting is enabled as it allows team members to read the message history in each channel. If it’s disabled, once a member logs off they will no longer see those new messages that came in when they were online. We want this setting enabled so someone can see new and past messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s it! Now that we’ve created categories and text channels, let’s move on to voice channels.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GM48WKSY357DVV55B5GX1B8B"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text channels</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re going to continue to use our example server, Orchard eSports, to help us in creating some text channels for our members to chat in! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One recommendation for creating a server is to have a </span><strong>welcome channel </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">for when new members join. This allows new users to get some information about the server and allows you, your mods, and even server members to see when someone new has joined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910542322071" alt="community_server_welcome_channel.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect! You can see here that when a new member joins the message is automatically shared in the </span><strong>welcome channel</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can have this information shared anywhere, but it is quite handy for when new members join especially if an admin or a moderator needs to add specific roles for this user.</span></p>
<h3><strong>To set up the system message for when someone joins the server head to Server Settings &gt; Overview and set the channel under “System Messages Channel”. While there you can also enable or disable any additional settings for the system message.</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910567418903" alt="community_server_announcements_channel.jpg"></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go ahead and also create an </span><strong>announcements channel</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is where an admin or moderator can post updates about the server or upcoming tournaments. This channel should be readable by anyone that joins it, however, only admins and moderators should be able to post in this channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we want new members in the server to be able to read the announcement channel, but not be able to post any messages of their own, we'll want to restrict their permission access. </span></p>
<h3>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about channel permissions, please check out the </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10543994968087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Channel Permissions Settings 101</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article.</span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some examples of enabled settings and how the announcement permissions are set up for everyone and why. These are completely personal preferences based around your specific server.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910602360471" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_1.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>View Channel</strong> - This setting is enabled so it allows everyone to be able to view the announcements channel.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910603143063" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_2.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Add Reactions</strong> - This setting is enabled so members can add reactions to posts. This is great for polls or just seeing the overall sentiment towards something posted.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910597374231" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_3.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Use External Emoji </strong>- This setting is enabled so members can use emojis from other servers as long as they have <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Nitro</a>.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910598252695" alt="community_server_announcements_setting_4.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Read Message History</strong> - This setting is enabled as it allows users to see the message history in the channel. We want this setting on so someone can see new and past announcements.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910606090903" alt="community_server_general_channel.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll also want to add a </span><strong>general channel</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where any member can chat with one another about anything. They can use this channel to group up and game together, share adorable cat photos, and more!</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GM48XMK2179J59796Q6Y4SZP"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice Channels</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we are going to set up voice channels for our example server, <em>Orchards eSports</em>, so our teams can communicate with one another. Voice channels are very similar to text channels in the sense that you can have specific permissions for them. Each team in this server has their own voice channel that only a member of that team has access to. These voice channels are in the team-specific categories, but you can also just have one category for all voice channels. After setting up team specific channels, we set up some general channels for the teams to come together and chat, or for other members of the server to join as well.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910600919831" alt="community_server_voice_channels.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go over the voice channel settings for the Lobby voice channel that we set up. This channel is set up so anyone within the server can join it, no matter what team they’re on.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910608560663" alt="community_server_voice_channels_connect.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connect</strong> - This is enabled so a member can actually connect to the voice channel.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910659773207" alt="community_server_voice_channels_speak.jpg"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Speak</strong> - This setting is enabled so a member can talk in a voice channel and they are not muted by default.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910661071639" alt="community_server_voice_channels_video.jpg"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Video</strong> - This setting allows members to share their video, screen share, or stream a game in this voice channel.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910662040215" alt="community_server_voice_channels_voice_activity.jpg"></span></p>
<p><strong>User Voice Activity </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This setting allows someone to use Voice Activity over using Push-to-Talk when it comes to speaking in this channel. If disabled, the member is required to use Push-to-Talk only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with the other settings, these are all going to come down to preferences for you and your server.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10910640267159" alt="community_server_conclusion.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s it, our server is created and we can start inviting more members! There are certainly a lot of options when it comes to setting up a full fledged Community Server and the settings you use can vary depending on how you want your server to be and what kind of server it is. You can always remove and add channels and other settings as your Discord server grows.</span></p>
