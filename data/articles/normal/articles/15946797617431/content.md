<h1 id="h_01HAD8XEZPCZ38NAG9NJAYCEQA">What is the Members page?</h1>
<p>The <strong>Members</strong> page provides moderators and admins with a dashboard view of new and existing server members within your server.</p>
<p>From this page, you can see the following information regarding your server members:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When they joined the server</li>
    <li>The age of their Discord account</li>
    <li>The invite link they used to join</li>
    <li>Their current server roles</li>
    <li>Signals that provide relevant safety information on users, such as who may be engaging in unusual DM activity or are timed out</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01HAD8XEZP095H4QXP1QAA600P">How does the Members page work?</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HAD8XEZPDDZZM8H2GXR3X4SF"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">To utilize the Members page, you will need to be the owner of that server or have the following permissions for that server: administrator, manage server, ban members, or kick members. </span></h3>
<p>If you meet either requirements, then you can head into the server of your choice and select the <strong>Members </strong>tab above the server’s channel list. This will load a page where you can view all server members within that specific server.</p>

<h3 id="docs-internal-guid-af88eee7-7fff-2736-e7d2-ada233e92486"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Note: The Members page is currently only available on browser/desktop. </span></h3>
<h1 id="h_01HAD96EADBQ0G1V8RE27ATP8E">Managing Server Members</h1>
<p>While navigating through the Members page, there are useful tools you can use to manage your server members.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HAD96EADXYYWVRBF85F6TV67">Adding Roles </h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">To add roles to a specific server member (assuming you have the Manage Roles permission), hover over the <strong>Roles</strong> category and press the [+] button.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17566474157847" alt="manage_1_remove_user.png"></p>

<h1 id="h_01H5K0Z9RJ0AT89DSSRFDGYA8Y">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-e091bdd2-7fff-8089-c2cb-77f54ede7ef7"><strong>Q: Which servers have access to the Members page?</strong></p>
<p>A: At this time, the new Members page is available to all Community-enabled servers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How are the Signals defined?</strong></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-8ac37960-7fff-a481-2afc-ef6b4b2623eb">A: We can’t share the specific details around the Unusual DM Activity flag at this time. The Timed Out flags are displayed for users who have been timed out.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-4f6d035e-7fff-cb0e-2232-62dca65f1ecc"><strong>Q: Who can see the Members page?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, the Members page is visible for the server’s owner and admins who have admin/manage server/kick/ban permissions.</p>
<p>Specific information like invite codes will require Manage Server permission.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who can see the Members page?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, the Members page is visible for your team members who have admin/manage/kick/ban permissions.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-8b6e97d6-7fff-4709-1cc3-80414bcc9770"><strong>Q: Is the Members page available on mobile?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Members page is only available for browser/desktop at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why doesn’t the Members page show a list of all of my members?</strong></p>
<p>A: We currently are only able to display around 10,000 number of your server’s most recent members. We are looking to expand this soon, but in the meantime, if your server has over 10,000 members, it may mean your Members page doesn’t display all your members. You can, however, search for members (via username or user ID) through the Members page without any limitations.</p>
