<h1 id="h_01H5K0Y70GPG70HPQNW250HJ9Q">What is the Members page?</h1>
<p>The <strong>Members</strong> page provides moderators and admins with a dashboard view of new and existing server members within your server.</p>
<p>From this page, you can see the following information regarding your server members:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When they joined the server</li>
    <li>The age of their Discord account</li>
    <li>The invite link they used to join</li>
    <li>Their current server roles</li>
    <li>Flags that will appear for users who have engaged in unusual DM activity or have been timed out</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01H5K0YCFMDW23F104BFNATB5J">How does the Members page work?</h1>
<p>To utilize the Members page, you will need to be the owner of that server or a server admin. If you meet either requirements, then you can head into the server of your choice and select the <strong>Members </strong>tab in the server’s channel list. This will redirect you to the page where you can view all server members. </p>
