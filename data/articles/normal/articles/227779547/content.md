<p>Sometimes, that homework assignment needs your full attention, or maybe you're just casually hanging out chatting it up with friends. Luckily Discord has 4 separate online statuses that let you pick and choose how you appear to others and keep your focus intact in other places if you need it.</p>
<h2><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Manual Override</span></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium">To change your status, it's as simple as left-clicking your user avatar that you'll find in the lower-left corner of the client:</span></p>

<p>Business as usual. You'll appear online with a green circle beside your avatar.</p>

<p>Normally, you'll automatically switch to idle if you're AFK for a certain amount of time, but you can manually select it in the pop-up menu. Unlike the auto-idle status, manually setting idle will allow you to stay that way indefinitely.</p>

<p>Setting yourself to Do Not Disturb (DnD) will show your avatar with a red circle and automatically mute any and all desktop notifications you'd normally receive. </p>

<p>Setting yourself as Invisible will make you appear offline entirely, but you'll still be able to access all of Discord as normal. This includes messaging your friends without appearing online.<br><br>You also have the ability to create a custom status to let you personalize this status a bit further!
