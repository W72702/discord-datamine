<p>Highlights bring you the best content from the servers you care about. If you are opted in to receive Highlights for a server, Discord will notify you via email of the best messages, events, announcements, and more from that server.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HAMZ2WJG13QVBE0NHZQ9Q07A">What are Highlights notifications?</h1>
<p>Highlights lets you know about key moments happening in the servers you care about. This will include things like popular posts, events, friend activity, new forums, and more. We built this for those of you who want a notification option between receiving all messages and receiving nothing.</p>
<p>Today, you might see two types of highlight notifications:</p>
<h2 id="h_01HAMZ2WJG7779JZRRP0GYBCY7">Conversations with your friends</h2>
<h3 id="h_01HAMZ2WJG8Q9MYSFJE44ZZRX2"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">This feature is currently an experiment and only available to a limited number of servers.</span></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17629501517975" alt="highlights.png"></p>
<p>Occasionally, you might receive a notification about a conversation your friends are having – something especially useful on busier servers where you don’t want to (or can’t) receive a notification for every message (i.e. your notifications are set to @mentions only). We factor in the people you usually talk to and the servers/channels you care about when deciding when to send the notification.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HAMZ2WJGV44TBDM9R2W3SCH3">Popular Messages</h2>
<p>Occasionally, you might receive a notification about a popular message in a server. We figure out what’s popular using factors such as how many reactions/replies a message received, and we also consider servers/channels where you are most active.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HAMZ2WJGXC57STS5MGNVVY8D">Suppress Highlights</h1>
<p>The <strong>Suppress Highlights</strong> setting is an additional toggle you can turn on or off in each server. It is located in your server notification settings. This setting operates independently of your server notification settings (<strong>all messages</strong>, <strong>@mentions only</strong>, or <strong>nothing</strong>). For example, you can have your server notifications settings set to <strong>Nothing</strong> and still receive Highlights notifications if the toggle is on. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17629501524759" alt="highlights_settings.png"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17629501530007" alt="highlights_settings_2.png"></p>
<p>Muting a server will turn off the Highlights toggle, and you will not receive any notifications from that server.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HAMZ2WJGFGGF2S3ZA257TD5F">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: How can I turn on or off Highlights for all of my servers?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can turn Highlights on or off by navigating to the server notifications setting menu and enabling <strong>Suppress Highlights</strong>. Currently, these settings can only be changed one server at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are Highlights personalized to me?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, the information that Discord uses to determine if something is considered a Highlight might depend on your activity on Discord, along with details about the server or channel. Discord relies on information such as how often you visit a server, the number of reactions to a post, or the number of attendees at an event in a server. </p>
<p>At any point in time, you may choose to turn on or off this personalized experience on Discord via <strong>the personalization toggle in your </strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004109911-Data-Privacy-Controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy &amp; Safety settings</a><strong>.</strong></p>
