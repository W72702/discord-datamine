<h1>Highlights Setting</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highlights setting is an additional toggle you can turn on or off in each server. It is located in your server notification settings. This setting operates independently of your server notification settings (<strong>all messages</strong>, <strong>@mentions only</strong>, or <strong>nothing</strong>). For example, you can have your server notifications settings set to <strong>Nothing</strong> and still receive Highlights notifications if the toggle is on. </span></p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: How can I turn on or off Highlights for all of my servers?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can turn Highlights on or off by navigating to the server notifications setting menu. Currently, these settings can only be changed one server at a time.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Discord use my personal data for Highlights?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the information that Discord uses to determine if something is considered a Highlight might depend on some personal data, along with details about the server or channel. Discord relies on information such as how often you visit a server, the number of reactions to a post, or the number of attendees at an event in a server. </span></p>
