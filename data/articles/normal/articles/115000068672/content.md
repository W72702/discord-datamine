<p>These filters are customizable and you can choose to turn them off.

<p>With the explicit image filter, you can automatically block messages in your server that may contain explicit images in channels that are not marked as Age-restricted.</p>
<p>You have the ability to manage this feature and determine whether it should apply to all members within the server or only to those who do not have assigned roles. Additionally, if this feature is not desired, it can be disabled entirely.</p>
<p>You can access this setting by navigating to <strong>Server Settings</strong>, and under <strong>Moderation</strong>, select <strong>Safety</strong> <strong>Setup</strong>, and then find the “<strong>Explicit image filter”</strong> heading.</p>

<p><a href="https://discord.com/safety/360043653552-Age-Restricted-Content-on-Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age-restricted channels</a> are exempt from the explicit image filter. Turning this filter on allows your server members to share content while reducing the risk of explicit images being posted in channels that are not age-restricted.</p>
