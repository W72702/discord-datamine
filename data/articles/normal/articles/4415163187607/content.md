<h1 id="h_01GXS8A8K3KS5H407NZT2A43RX"><strong>WHAT IS A SERVER SUBSCRIPTION?</strong></h1>
<p>A Server Subscription is a monthly subscription to a server that helps support the communities and creators that run them. At the discretion of the creator/admin of the server, membership can be divided into tiers; each tier may have unique pricing and perks.</p>
<p>Creators/server admins provide the premium membership. They are responsible for creating the tiers and their descriptions, and they also provide the subscriptions themselves and any associated content or other perks. Please read the tier descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</p>
<p>Because these are recurring subscriptions, you’ll be charged monthly until you cancel the subscription (which you can do anytime from the Premium section in User Settings).</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with your Server Subscription, contact the creator/server admin directly. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, you can request a refund as described below. </p>
<p>If you experience technical issues preventing you from accessing your Server Subscription, contact us at<a href="http://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> dis.gd/billing</a> and choose <strong>Server Subscription</strong> under <strong>Type of billing issue</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h_01GXS8QWVJXBH1PJ4KP942M5PM"><strong>CAN I ASK FOR A REFUND FOR MY SERVER SUBSCRIPTION?</strong></h2>

<h1 id="h_01GXS8R9AVGAC8PRKTB13D53ZD">Server Subscriptions iOS </h1>
<p>Server Subscriptions can now be purchased on mobile (iOS)! Support your favorite creators and communities by subscribing directly from the Discord iOS app.</p>
<h2 id="h_01GXS8RFFFKYZ1CGYAC0BZZ6MD">Frequently Asked Questions for iOS</h2>
<p><strong>Q. Do mobile subscriptions cost the same as desktop subscriptions?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. Apple takes an additional 30% of revenue from all subscriptions initiated through the Discord iOS application. Subscribers on iOS mobile devices will see a higher price on iOS checkout to account for the additional iOS fee. </p>
<p>More information on the fee structures is available in the Monetization Terms: <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms</a></p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I change (upgrade or downgrade) my current tier mid-month on iOS?</strong></p>
<p>A. Currently, we do not support upgrading or downgrading your tier mid-cycle if the subscription was initiated on the Discord iOS app.</p>
<p>However, you can cancel your subscription, wait for it to end, and then purchase the new tier you want. For example, if you have a subscription to tier A that renews on March 24, but you want to purchase tier B, you will need to cancel tier A, and wait for the subscription to end on March 24 — then you will be able to purchase tier B.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will subscriptions be purchasable on Android?</strong></p>
<p>A: We’re working on it! We don’t have any timing to share at this point but we are actively working to bring Server Subscriptions to Android mobile devices.</p>
