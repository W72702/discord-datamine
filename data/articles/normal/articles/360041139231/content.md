We didn't want your Discord memes to be dreams, so we've got a nifty little system to keep track of all your emojis to always be on hand for when the occasion arises.</p>

<p>Adding an emoji to your message is pretty simple! Just hover your mouse over the grayed-out <strong>Emoji Picker</strong> button to the right of your text bar:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 51px; width: 624px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540900390551"></p>
<p>Once the Emoji Picker pops open, you can select your emoji from the list and even filter the emojis by using the buttons at the bottom of the picker:</p>

<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">PRO TIP: Hold shift and left-click to place multiple emojis:<span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img style="height: 378px; width: 458px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540900848023"></span>
</h3>
<p>The Emoji Picker will sort custom emojis by server, so they're easy to pick out:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 476px; width: 479px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540901159191"></p>
<p>You'll notice that some servers have both grayed out and globally available emojis. A grayed out emoji either means you don't have access to posting that emoji in other servers, or it's an animated emoji.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-Discord-Nitro-Classic-Nitro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro or Nitro classic</a> to gain the ability to post custom emojis everywhere, and gain access to animated emojis!</p>
<p>Custom created server emojis are server specific; while integrated emojis (i.e. Twitch subscription emotes) are available for use globally.</p>
<h1 id="h_01H06HNXCTGV79QRFEZSP2S6J3">Wumboji Upgrade</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img style="height: 176px; width: 467px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540906144279"></strong></p>
<p>Given a little room to grow, emojis will size up and show a bigger version of themselves! <strong>Typing a message with no other characters and just emoji will result in wumboji being shown.</strong></p>
<p>You can have up to 27 wumboji in a message before they get too crowded and size back down.</p>
<h3>NOTE: Emoji won't wumboji themselves in Compact mode.</h3>

<h3 id="docs-internal-guid-f19e3647-7fff-6b42-4040-275cba65a01f"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Please note: We are currently experimenting with permissions, so the changes to the permissions here are not yet live yet to everyone.</span></h3>
<p>As a server owner or admin, you can manage who can add, edit, and remove emojis within your server. </p>
<p>If you would like to allow a role to add custom emojis, you can enable the <strong>Create Expressions </strong>permission. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 97px; width: 487px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540900501143"></p>
<p>Additionally<strong>,</strong> members will need to have the <strong>Manage Expressions</strong> permission enabled if you  would like for them to edit or remove custom emojis.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 113px; width: 478px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540900497303"></p>
<p>1. To get started, head into your <strong>Server Settings</strong> by selecting the drop-down menu located next to the server name. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 408px; width: 474px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540906135319"></p>
<p>2. Once redirected, choose the <strong>Roles</strong> tab and select the specific role you would like to manage. </p>
<p>3. While in the <strong>Edit Role </strong>page, navigate to <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">4. You will now be able to toggle the Create Expressions and Manage Expressions permissions under <strong>General Server Permissions</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 383px; width: 518px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540900822295"></p>
<p>5. Once the permissions have been set, press <strong>Save Changes </strong>to confirm the changes you have made. </p>
<h1 id="h_01H06HP9NBEYPG94XTSTNVXN4D">Adding a Custom Emoji</h1>
<p>In addition to your standard universal emojis, you can easily add custom emojis to your server and sync with your favorite streamers to use their integrated Twitch emotes as well.</p>
<p>If you’re the server owner or have <a href="#h_01H06HP2FN73FY03Q41GP05F6Q" target="_self"><strong>Create Expressions </strong>permission enabled</a>, you can head over to your server and add up to 50 custom emojis to your personalized stash. Just head into the Server Settings and select the <strong>Emoji</strong> tab to upload any custom emojis to share with your entire server. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="height: 280px; width: 600px;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14540906096023"></p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Emoji names must be at least 2 characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.</li>
    <li>For optimal emoji resolution, you can upload them in sizes up to <strong><em>128x128 pixels</em></strong>, but they will be resized to <strong><em>32x32 pixels</em></strong>. Additionally, the emoji file size must be smaller than <strong>256KB</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Your custom emojis are only usable on the server you've uploaded them to. However, if you have</strong><a href="https://discord.com/nitro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Discord Nitro</a><strong>, you'll be able to use your custom emojis on every server, group, and DM you're in!</strong>
</h3>
<p>Without a Nitro subscription, custom emojis can <strong>ONLY</strong> be used in the server they were uploaded on. If you try to enter an emoji from another server, only the emoji text code will appear. And if you try to select the emoji from the Emoji Picker you'll receive this message:</p>
