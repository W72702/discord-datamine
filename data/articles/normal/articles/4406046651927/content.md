<h1><strong>WHAT ARE DISCORD STUDENT HUBS?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong>Discord Student Hub</strong> is a place for students to meet classmates from their school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each hub is only accessible to users with an email address associated with that school. Students will be able to find other classmates that have joined the hub, add their servers to the hub, and find their classmates' servers, all in one place.</span></p>
<h1>General FAQ</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Where are Student Hubs available? </strong></span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubs are currently live for a number of schools in Australia, Canada, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the USA. It is now possible for students in many countries across the world to sign-up for the waitlist. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Is this a Discord partnership with high schools/colleges? </strong></span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hubs are not officially affiliated with or managed by schools. A Student Hub is a collection of student-run servers. The Hub’s function is to make it easier for classmates to find and join one another’s servers if they choose to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Who has access to a hub? </strong></span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only people with a school-issued email address can access their school’s Student Hub. Even though the servers listed in the school’s Student Hub are run by students, people do not need to be a member of the Student Hub to be invited to join the listed servers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>How will my school email address be used? </strong></span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your school email address will be used to verify which student hub you can access. It will not be visible to other users on Discord, and it will not be shared with your school.</span></li>
