<p>As of <strong>October 9th, 2019</strong>, we became aware that a number of popular bots used for playing music in Discord servers are no longer functioning as expected when attempting to play music from particular websites.<br><br>The developers of several of these bots have confirmed that a number of websites, including YouTube and Soundcloud, have limited the access these bots have to music hosted on their sites. The scope of the impacted sites may change and the bot developers will have more up to date information on hand!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because we do not maintain or host any of these bots, we sadly cannot provide troubleshooting for this specific issue through our support portal.<br><br>If you're experiencing an issue playing music with a bot in your server, <strong>please make sure to visit the website hosting the bot or the bot developer's website</strong> to learn more information from the developer regarding the potential impacts of this change and any updates on planned alternatives and solutions!</p>
