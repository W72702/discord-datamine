    <h2 id="h_01GV71BZ5SHH2R4C8CG3YJ9QT9"><strong>Eligibility for the Promotion</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Who can take part in this Nitro promotion?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A: </strong>You must be a Cash App user and have a Cash Card to get 99% off their first month of a Discord Nitro subscription. If you have purchased Discord Nitro using your Cash Card in the last 12 months, you are ineligible for the 1 month Nitro deal. </p>
    <p><strong>Q: What if I'm a current or previous Nitro Basic subscriber or a Server Boost subscriber? Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></p>
    <p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, if you currently have a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting subscription, you will be eligible to buy this promotion after you cancel your current subscription. Once you do, you will be able to buy the monthly Nitro subscription through Cash App.</p>
    <h2 id="h_01GV71C7DAAAJAHCHF57846T88"><strong>Payment Info and Subscription Questions</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to get Nitro?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your month trial, your Cash Card will be billed monthly so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p>
    <p>However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time in the <strong>Subscriptions </strong>tab of your Discord client’s <strong>User Setting</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> There will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the Cash Card payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>
    <p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>
    <h3><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>
    <p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>
    <h2 id="h_01GV71CGRA21FD8EQM2VWYSAMC"><strong>Potential Errors and Other Issues</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Q: I see a "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error after I try to buy Nitro using my Cash Card.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to buy this promotion for currently has a Nitro subscription, so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>
    <p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on or cancel your current the Nitro, Nitro Basic, or Nitro Classic subscription to take part in this Nitro deal on Cash App.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: I see a "Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption" error when trying to redeem my promo link!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a "Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>
    <p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this article</a>!</p>
