<p>Microphones are great however sometimes you just want to be a robot, right?</p>
<p>The Text-to-Speech (TTS) function will help you achieve your wildest robot dreams by reading what you type directly to your channel.</p>
<h1>Sending Text-to-Speech</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">This is the easy part. To have a sentence read in Text-to-Speech, just type <strong>/tts</strong> before your sentence. So, to read this sentence:</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>"Discord's pretty awesome"</strong></span></p>
<p>Just type:</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>/tts Discord's pretty awesome</strong></span></p>
<h3><em>Important Note: TTS follows the default system settings of how Discord is being used. Internet browsers such as Chrome or Firefox have a different Text-to-Speech reading bot than Windows or Mac do. Depending on what platform you're using, you'll be hearing different TTS voices!</em></h3>
<h1>Make it stop!</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">We get it, the troll in your channel just had the TTS bot read "WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"... Well, we have two selective methods to trim <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> channels have the privilege of utilizing TTS.</span></p>
<h2>Method One: Notification Settings &amp; Server-Wide Mute</h2>
<p>The first TTS toggle setting can be found here:</p>
<p><strong>User Settings -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Text-to-Speech</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002556711/Text_to_Speech_1.PNG" alt="Text_to_Speech_1.PNG" width="601" height="204"></p>
<p> You'll see three selections here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="wysiwyg-underline">For all channels</span>: This setting allows any channel, across any server, to have messages be read in Text-to-Speech,<strong> regardless if they use the /tts command or not.</strong> You'll be hearing a fair amount of TTS across all of your channels if you have this enabled. Use with caution!
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="wysiwyg-underline">For current selected channel:</span> This setting means the current text channel you have selected will have messages read in Text-to-Speech.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Never</span>: No matter how hard your friends try, you won't ever hear the dulcet tones of the Text-to-Speech bot anywhere within Discord. (Unless you engage it yourself, of course.)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This Screen is particularly useful if you want to hear what your friends are typing. </p>
<h2>Method Two: Read your own sentences!</h2>
<p>The second TTS toggle setting can be found here:</p>
<p><strong>User Settings button &gt; App Settings &gt; Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Use the Text to speech rate setting to adjust the speed at which the text is being read back to you.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4407495059863/Screenshot_96.png" alt="Screenshot_96.png"></p>
<p>What this does is enable or disable the <strong>/tts </strong>command. If you have this option de-selected, and type in a <strong>/tts</strong> sentence the Text-to-Speech bot will not read it aloud. A sad tale indeed.</p>
<h3><em>Important Note: The TTS option in the Accessibility tab is completely separate from the TTS options in the Notifications tab. If a user has TTS notifications enabled like in method one, they will hear your sentences written in TTS, regardless of what TTS settings you've selected. Similarly, if they disable TTS notifications, they won't hear your sentences read in TTS at all.</em></h3>
<p>That wraps that up! We wish you the best in your robot adventures and hope that these tips will help you Discord!</p>
