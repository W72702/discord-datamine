<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>
<p>For more information about Activities on Discord, go <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Word Snacks. However, you must be at least 18 years old to play Poker Night.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the Word Snacks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voice channels. Once there, you should see a button below the voice-connected area that has a rocket ship – this is the Activity Launcher. Click this to open the Activity Shelf, and then select </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Word Snacks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href="https://dis.gd/bugreport">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>
<p>For instructions on how bug reports should be submitted, please see our Help Center article: <a href="https://dis.gd/bugs">https://dis.gd/bugs</a> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Word Snacks</em> through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_self">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enhance the gameplay experience, Word Snacks accesses and temporarily stores the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord ID</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Username</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained by Word Snacks.</span></p>
