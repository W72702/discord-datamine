<p>Bobble Bash is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity</a> developed by Discord. It is a tabletop point collection game, where players bash their way between obstacles to score and win. Think shuffleboard meets bumper cars. Similar to Bobble League, the game features turn-based strategy and physics.</p>

<h1 id="h_01H69PGWK98E4VHGFDD5KGDMDR">HOW TO PLAY BOBBLE BASH</h1>
<p>Vote on a series! Two of the five series will appear on the screen for players to vote on. Each series has four levels for you to bash your way through to victory. The Random Series is a selection of four levels from any of the series.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/16313214271511" alt="bobble_bash_how_to_play.gif"></p>
<p>There is a limit of 8 active players in Bobble Bash. Once 8 players have voted, a “Game is full'' message will appear.</p>
<p>To spectate, players can opt out of voting and will automatically be transitioned into the spectator queue once the game starts. If a spectator wishes to join a game in progress, they can click the “join game” button and will start playing at the start of the next level in the series.</p>
<p>Start the game! Once at least one player votes on a series, the countdown timer starts. When it reaches zero, anyone who has voted will be taken to the first level.</p>

<p>Move your Bobble and collect points! Click (or tap) and drag to aim. The color and length of your aim arrow reflect the strength and distance of your move.</p>
<p>Players gain points by collecting diamonds, gems, and stars. Points are also awarded when colliding with obstacles and other players. Certain levels have specific goals or waypoints that earn points as well!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why is there a motion and photosensitivity warning?</strong></p>
<p>A: A percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games.
