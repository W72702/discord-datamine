<p>There comes a time in everyone's Discord lives where your baby server is all grown up into a full-fledged public forum, and you'll need to send it off to a new owner to take care of full time. Or maybe you just want a friend to look after your server while you're out. Whatever the case, we've added the ability to transfer server ownership! Let's check it out:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open up your 'Server Settings' tab by clicking on the Server Name box:</p>

<p>And there you go! After completing the transfer you will still be a member of the server. The access you retain will depend on the permissions tied to your role. </p>
