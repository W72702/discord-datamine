<h3>IMPORTANT NOTE: Server Home is being phased out as of March 22, 2023. While Home made it easy for members to catch up on a community’s best moments in one place, we’ve made the difficult decision to prioritize our time building other features that will enable you to create a more welcoming, informative experience for your new members. In fact, the learnings we’ve gleaned from Home will be applied towards building exciting new features!</h3>

<h1 id="h_01G3C88H9TDHD1RDFJCRWR7RK0">What is Server Home?</h1>
<p>Server Home is a new space at the top of a channel list where members can see a digest of interesting moments happening in the community.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11475724079383" alt="server-home-example.png"></p>
<h1 id="h_01G3C892NP0R6EGAAZ3DXG8913">Where can I find Server Home?</h1>
<p>Server Home is located at the top of the channel list.</p>
<h3><em>Note: Currently it will not appear for members who can see fewer than 5 channels.</em></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><em><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11603539433367" alt="UPDATED-server-home-icon-in-server-channel-list.png" width="310" height="381"></em></p>
<h2 id="h_01G3C89GG8KZ7BMHTPNCV9BF0X">How does content appear in Server Home?</h2>
<p>There are two main sections for Server Home:</p>
<p><strong>1. Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>This section is a selection of top messages that allows you to quickly catch up on recent activity in the server.</li>
    <li>This section will only show content in channels you have access to.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11603617344279" alt="UPDATED-server-home-highlights-example.png"></p>
<h3><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Note: if a member has muted a channel they will not see any content in Home from that channel.</span></h3>
<p><strong>2. Active Now:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">This section shows where conversations are happening <em>right now</em> that you can actively participate in. Similar to Highlights, this will only show channels that you have access to.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/11475724058391" alt="server-home-active-now-example.png" width="357" height="360"></p>
<h2 id="h_01G3C89R33Q8PX7EK6VSNB0XEA"><strong>Behavior</strong></h2>
<p>By default, visiting a server will land on Home. However, if you have been to the server recently, you will continue to be taken to your last visited channel instead. This ensures Home doesn’t get in the way if you're in the middle of participating in conversations.</p>
<h1 id="h_01G3C89WKRBAS2N63JN9KANVYV">Can you curate content?</h1>
<p>Yes! Currently, only people with the <strong><code>Manage Messages</code></strong> permission can curate content in 3 ways:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Featuring messages:</span> You can feature <span class="discussion-id-d45d8fd9-47b1-451a-9959-77a845603ac5 discussion-level-1 discussion-id-d45d8fd9-47b1-451a-9959-77a845603ac5 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="2" data-reactroot="">a message at the top</span> of Home <span class="discussion-id-51d1c749-f09d-4584-bb5e-11249a68269c discussion-level-1 discussion-id-51d1c749-f09d-4584-bb5e-11249a68269c notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="4" data-reactroot="">for a period of time</span> for <span class="discussion-id-25098b54-30b9-471c-a58a-faca4f7d7145 discussion-level-1 discussion-id-25098b54-30b9-471c-a58a-faca4f7d7145 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="6" data-reactroot="">any member who hasn’t seen it yet</span>. This message is not pinned so once a member goes to Home and sees the message it will no longer be featured at the top. Great for highlighting cool contributions or conversations from your members, events, questions of the day, etc. You can do this by opening the message context menu by right-clicking and selecting “Feature Message” </p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Note: Currently you can only feature messages for either 24 hours, 3 days, or 7 days</span></li>

<h2 id="h_01G3C8A2FMG2PWW7NRWG56PH7Q">How do I join the beta or leave feedback?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, this feature is an experiment available to a select number of communities over 5,000 members. Eventually, Home will be a part of every Community-enabled server.</span></li>
    <li>If your community has Home and you want to leave feedback, you can find a survey in the <strong>Home settings context menu</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01G3C8A9PG5RDEET1QQTXZRC7F">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: My server has Home. Can I remove it?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: Currently, you cannot opt out of Home. However, if you have feedback on how we could improve the experience to make it valuable for your community, please fill out the survey in the Home settings context menu.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Can I change the location of Home?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: Currently you cannot move Home. However, if you have feedback on how this placement affects your community, please fill out the survey in the Home settings context menu!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I don’t see Home in my Server. Why?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: Right now it’s only available to a select number users of specific communities so it may not be available for you just yet. Additionally, if you don’t have access to at least 6 channels in the server, Home will not show. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: What if I don’t want my content to appear in Home?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: There’s currently no option to opt out of your content appearing in Home. However, only people who already have access to the channels you post your content in will be able to see your content Home. So if you post in a private channel only the members with access to that private channel would be able to see that content on Home.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Can people outside of my server see the Home section?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: No, just like other channels only people with access to your community can see the Home section. Additionally, only members who have been granted access to at least six channels in the server will see content from Home.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why are messages disappearing from my Home tab?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: Messages you've read get sorted to the bottom, while highlights you haven’t read yet will be prioritized at the top.</p>
