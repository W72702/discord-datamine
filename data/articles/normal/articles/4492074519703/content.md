<p>Hi folks! It’s Important Announcement Day<sup>TM</sup> again: we’re updating our <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339366295">Paid Services Terms</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>! These changes go into effect on <strong>March 27, 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>We regularly review our policies to ensure we're surfacing important information to our users in a clear and easy-to-understand way. As we continually work to improve our services and protect your privacy, we periodically update these policies to reflect those priorities and commitments to each other. </p>
<p>Here are some highlights of what we’ve updated:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How we describe our services: </strong>We added in a broader description of how Discord works, the features we offer, and how our services can be personalized for you. We want Discord to be <em>your </em>experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How we resolve disputes: </strong>We’ve updated our informal dispute resolution process and our arbitration agreement to lay out more detail on the steps you should take in case you have a dispute. We work hard to make sure you always love Discord and hope there’s never a dispute!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How we approach privacy: </strong>We provided more information about privacy rights and how they are exercised. We also updated what data we collect and how we use it. As always, your privacy is critically important to us, and we try to limit what information we collect and give you control over your privacy on Discord.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How we explain our Community Guidelines: </strong>Our Community Guidelines are the foundation for how we work to keep you safe and give everyone the ability to find belonging on Discord. We’ve added more context and updated our explanations so our rules are easier to understand.
    </li>
</ul>
