<h3><strong>Starting January 2022, all new versions of the Discord iOS app will require iOS 11.0 or later.</strong></h3>
<p>If you are running the Discord iOS app on iOS 10, you will still be able to use the last supported version of our app, but you will not receive further updates, barring critical security patches.</p>
<p>If you update your device to iOS 11 (or later), you will be able to download new versions of the Discord iOS app again.</p>
<h1>Why are we doing this?</h1>
<p>For a while, iOS 10 support has been hindering our ability to upgrade several core libraries inside our iOS app. We have made the decision to end iOS 10 support so that we can modernize these libraries. This will enable us to leverage the latest and greatest to continue improving the Discord iOS experience.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>Frankly speaking, there are very few Discord users left on iOS 10.</p>
<p>Among the millions of users that download our app in December of 2021, only 1300 downloaded it on a iOS 10 device. Throughout 2021, iOS 10 has been consistently less than 1% of our iOS user base every month; <a href="https://blog.discord.com/discord-is-dropping-support-for-android4-96ae06ae04b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far lower than the Android 4 user base when it was deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, iOS users tend to update quickly onto new versions of iOS. Apple reports that only 7% of devices use iOS 12 and below, and we are confident that iOS 10 is only a small sliver of that 7%.</p>

<p>Therefore, we are at a point where the user base is very small, and declining fast enough for us to be comfortable with this decision.</p>
