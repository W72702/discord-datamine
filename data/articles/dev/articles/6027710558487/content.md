<h2>Interactions</h2>
<p>We have a whole interaction suite that is part of our gateway now. If slash commands arenâ€™t right for your bot, there are <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6381892888087" target="_self">buttons</a>, <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6382655804311" target="_self">drop-down menus</a>, text boxes, context menus and more that you can use to interact with your bot. You can read more about them <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot=""><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id-1989099110">here</span></a>.</p>
