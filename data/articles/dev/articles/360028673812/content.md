<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Things to check</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Not being signed into the correct Discord account in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/" target="_self">developer portal</a> </li>
    <li>This account you're signed in on is not apart of the team that's associated with this application </li>
    <li>Haven't yet run <strong>dispatch login</strong> to authorize your Discord account </li>
</ul>
<p>Double check these three steps if you're running into this error. Additionally, give this documentation <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/dispatch/branches-and-builds#authorizing-yourself-to-use-it" target="_self">here</a> a close look. </p>
