<p>While attempting to verify your bot, you may have come across this error:</p>
<p class="callout">This application has been inorganically grown, so we cannot accept your application for verification at this time.</p>
<p>When this error appears, it means that a significant number of the servers your bot is in are owned by the same user, or the same set of users. This is considered inorganic growth and disqualifies a bot for verification.</p>
<p>To resolve this, we typically recommend avoiding adding your bot into too many of your own servers during its initial growth period, and using the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#get-current-user-guilds" target="_self">Current User Guilds</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#get-guild" target="_self">Guild</a> Endpoints to search for commonalities.</p>
<p>If you notice that a particular user or set of users has added your bot to multiple servers where it isn't being used, or is being used in a way that isn't intended, then you can have the bot leave those servers with a call to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#leave-guild" target="_self">Leave Guild</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">If your bot is in a number of servers that you control, you might want to consider managing your servers with a smaller, dedicated build of your bot that isnâ€™t designed to scale beyond your own guilds.</p>
<p>If you feel your bot has a legitimate use case for what appears to be inorganic growth, please feel free to reach out to us with the details <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360005592534" target="_self">here</a>!</p>
