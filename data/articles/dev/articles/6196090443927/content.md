<p>While attempting to verify your bot, you may have come across this error:</p>
<p class="callout">This application has suspicious growth, so we cannot accept your application for verification at this time. Please try again in a few weeks after seeing normal, non-advertised growth.</p>
<p>Fret not! This error is usually not a serious issue. This is a temporary verification freeze that will be lifted shortly. This automated cooldown period exists for the purposes of gathering more data for our verifiers to review.</p>
<p>During this time, your server limit is increased to 250 servers to prevent you from losing growth. Please wait at least 3 weeks, and if the problem persists after that point, contact developer support <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">here</a>.</p>
