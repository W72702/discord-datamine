<h2>Details</h2>
<p>If your bot is in more than 75 servers, you will see a banner at the top of its page on the Developer Portal with instructions on how to get started. Once you submit a verification request, a human will look at your submission and get back to you.</p>
<p>During this process, you will be prompted for information on your botâ€™s features, data storage practices, and other details. Providing thorough answers to these questions will help to ensure a speedy response to your application. Attaching screenshots or video can be a great way to help explain what your bot can do.</p>
<p>Please note that the owner of the bot or development team will need to verify through Stripe, our identity verification provider, as part of this process. If you have questions about this, please see our <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6226051178775" target="_self" rel="undefined">Stripe FAQ</a>.</p>
