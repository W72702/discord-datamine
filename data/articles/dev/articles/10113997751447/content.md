        <p id="0957bfce-cf6a-4410-8a59-0239b08a0cb9" class="">If you or your team have an active app, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/active-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Portal</a> to grab your badge! There, you should find a prompt to join the Active Developer Program and claim your badge, by following these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#70ebf968-173e-4ffb-86d5-2e417eeb20a4" target="_self">SELECT AN ACTIVE APP</a></li>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="70ebf968-173e-4ffb-86d5-2e417eeb20a4" class="wysiwyg-indent1">SELECT AN ACTIVE APP</h3>
        <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">First, select an app from the dropdown. Any active app will be eligible, as long as it has received a command within the past 30 days.</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">If you have an active app and feel you should be eligible for the Active Developer Badge, please allow at least 24 hours for your app's activity status to be updated.</p>
        <h3 id="h_01GHW11D9TAXKM9YVATV2P63BX" class="wysiwyg-indent1">DESIGNATE A COMMUNITY SERVER</h3>
        <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Next, designate your official server for your app (for example, your App Support Server, App Community Server or App Development Server).</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">In order for a server to appear in the server selection menu, it needs to be set as a <strong>Community Server,</strong> and you need to have Admin permission in that server.</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">If you don't see any servers in the Support Server list, make sure the one you are looking for is set as a Community Server. Here is more information on how to <strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable the community feature</a></strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="h_01GHW11VRTNAYAMAATV3MEB4VH" class="wysiwyg-indent1">CHOOSE A DEVELOPER NEWS CHANNEL</h3>
        <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Finally, select the channel within the designated server for the Developer News channel to appear in. This will allow for updates about Discord API and Developer News to be sent right to your server's channel.</p>
        <p id="eafec787-09b0-425e-bf6a-84805c27f107" class="wysiwyg-indent1">Once these steps are complete, you should see your new Active Developer Badge on your Profile! <strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

        <h2>I'M ON A TEAM, BUT CAN'T CLAIM THE BADGE</h2>
        <p>If an app is not owned by you, but you're a team member working on the application, you can claim the badge only if it's owned by a Developer Team in the Developer Portal. If the bot is currently owned by an individual, they'll need to transfer it to a Developer Team and invite you to that team in order to claim the badge.</p>
        <h2>WHAT KINDS OF COMMANDS QUALIFY?</h2>
        <p>Only application commands qualify. This typically refers to slash commands and context menu commands. Legacy prefix-based commands do not count, nor do other kinds of API interactions such as OAuth calls. </p>
        <h2>I RAN AN APPLICATION COMMAND, BUT IT'S STILL INELIGIBLE</h2>
        <p>In order for us to detect command usage, you or at least one person on the team that owns the app needs to have "Use data to improve Discord" enabled within <strong><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety</span></strong>. At least 24 hours need to pass after we detect a command, so make sure to wait at least 24 hours after enabling this setting before trying again.</p>
        <h2>I AM ELIGIBLE. WHEN WILL I RECEIVE THE BADGE?</h2>
        <p>The badge is not distributed automatically. In order to claim the Active Developer Badge, you must visit the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/active-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Portal</a> to claim it as <a href="#12558cc2-aad8-4894-872a-e0fa0a6d8044" target="_self">documented above</a>.</p>
        <h2>I CLAIMED MY BADGE, BUT I DON'T HAVE IT</h2>
        <p>If you successfully claimed your Active Developer Badge, but you don't see it on your Profile, try restarting/refreshing your client.</p>
        <h2>HOW DO I SWITCH MY ACTIVE APP?</h2>
        <p>Active status will be maintained <span class="discussion-level-1 discussion-id-f8fb99e4-2972-4a80-9b87-fbb69f2120a7 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">by any active apps you own or are owned by a team you are on</span>. So there is actually no need to switch apps!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>HOW DO I REMOVE THE BADGE?</h2>
        <p>If you revisit the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/active-developer" target="_self">Developer Portal</a> page where you first obtained the badge, you can click the 'Remove Badge' button. This will remove your badge immediately and if you refresh your Discord client, you will see the badge is no longer on your profile.</p>

        <h2 id="h_01GPP5AFAB3E7PAN374XQD60BP">MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <p>Eligibility for the Active Developer Badge, as listed above in the <a href="#h_01GHW0K8D4MR19TG7BN0SZM7R0" target="_self">Am I Eligible section</a>, will need to be maintained in order to keep the badge. If a bot does not remain active, the badge will be lost. After 30 days of inactivity, you’re at risk of losing eligibility. We’ll send you an email giving you 30 more days to fix any issues before removing the badge from your profile, so keep an eye on your inbox!</p>
