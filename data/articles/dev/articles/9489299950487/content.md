<h2>App Directory: Discovery</h2>
<p>The App Directory is a discoverable surface where server owners and admins can browse through a variety of verified apps and add them to their servers. In order for apps to be included in the App Directory, application owners must enable discovery for their application.</p>
<h2>App Directory: Content Requirements</h2>
<p>In order for your application to be discoverable in App Directory, your application’s content must meet certain content requirements. Applications that do not meet these content requirements are not eligible to be listed or discoverable in the App Directory. In order to be eligible for discovery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You and your application must continue to comply with <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord’s Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord Community Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service">Discord Developer Terms of Service</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy">Discord Developer Policy</a>.</li>
    <li>Your application must have a connected and publicly available Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</li>
    <li>Your application’s content must not contain any age-restricted content. Age-Restricted content includes but is not limited to content and discussion related to:
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Your application name, description, and commands must not contain any IP-violating content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enabling Discovery</h2>
