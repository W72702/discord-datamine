<p class="callout">Update: We are no longer offering the ability to purchase a license to sell PC games starting December 1, 2021. On March 1, 2022, we are sunsetting store channel functionality. You can read more at <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6309018858647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent users from continuing to purchase your game you'll want to remove the store page that's selling your game. <br><br>To do this you'll want to go to the store channel's setting on your server. <br><br><img src="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360050856292/1_.jpg" alt="1_.jpg"></p>
<p>From there select <strong>Delete Channel</strong> &amp; confirm. <br><br><img src="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360050978811/2_.jpg" alt="2_.jpg"></p>
<p>If you'd like to remove IAP or DLC you can always delete the store page to those SKUs using the same process listed above.<br><br>If you have the IAP or DLC listed on the store page for the base game - using <strong>Related SKUs </strong>in the <strong>developer portal</strong> is where you'll want to remove these SKUs. Click the X and save the changes. </p>
