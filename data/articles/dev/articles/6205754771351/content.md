<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>You can apply for Privileged Intents as part of the bot verification process, or anytime after, from your bot’s page on the Developer Portal.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>If your bot is not yet verified, you will have the option to apply for Privileged Intents during the verification process. Note that unverified bots can use Privileged Intents without needing to apply; just turn them on from the bot’s page on the Developer Portal.</p>
<p>If your bot is already verified, and you’d like access to a new Privileged Intent for your bot, have a look at the top of your bot’s settings page on the Developer Portal. You should see a button there to begin the process. If you don't see that and believe you should, please <a href="https://dis.gd/contact">reach out to us via support</a>. Once you submit an application, a human will look at your submission and get back to you.</p>
<p>When you apply for Privileged Intents, you'll be redirected to a questionnaire. We'll ask you a few questions including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which Intents you're applying for</li>
    <li>Your use case for those Intents</li>
    <li>Some data security and privacy questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing thorough answers to these questions will help to ensure the best outcome for your request. Attaching screenshots or video can be especially valuable to help explain how your bot uses Privileged Intents.</p>
<p>Access to Privileged Intents is approved or denied based in part on your bot’s use case for the information gated by the intent.
