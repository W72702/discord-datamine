<h2>Some Changes</h2>
<p>On Sept 1, 2022, we are providing an updated Developer Terms of Service (ToS) and Developer Policy and a one-month review period. These updated terms and policy will go into effect on Oct 1, 2022.</p>
<p>We regularly review our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>provide developers with more clarity on what to expect from us, and what we expect from them, as they use our APIs</li>
    <li>make sure developers are up-to-date with legal, policy, and other requirements</li>
    <li>allow us to continue offering developers new and improved features relating to our APIs, while maintaining a healthy app ecosystem for our developer community and our users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's Changed?</h3>
<p>With our latest and upcoming feature releases (such as new discovery surfaces for apps on Discord) and our continued efforts to protect user privacy and safety, we’re updating our terms and policy to provide more details to developers around how developers and their apps can access and use our APIs and data, how we can use apps and content that developers make available to us, notification obligations relating to security incidents, enforcement actions we can take, and legal requirements, as well as to improve overall clarity and consistency with our other applicable terms and policies.</p>
