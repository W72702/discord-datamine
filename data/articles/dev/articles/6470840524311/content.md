<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>If you are not seeing the <strong>Copy</strong> button located in your bot settings to copy your bot's token, this means the token has already been viewed once and is now hidden. You will need to regenerate the token using the <strong>Reset Token</strong> button and paste that new token into your code.</p>

<h2 id="h_01G56XR6D2HY7K3BHQ2A6C4ZZC">WHY DID THE COPY BUTTON DISAPPEAR?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the copy button has disappeared from the Bot page in the Developer Portal. After you have viewed the token once and leave the page, you no longer have access to it. This is put in place for security reasons. If you forgot to copy your token, it will need to be regenerated and changed in any code where the old one might have been used.</p>
