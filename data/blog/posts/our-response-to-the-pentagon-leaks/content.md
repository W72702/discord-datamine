            <p><br>In recent days, U.S. government documents alleged to be classified were shared on Discord servers. The appearance of these documents on our platform was unusual – conversations on Discord generally relate to video games, music, art, sports, and other interests of our users around the world. </p>
            <p>Classified military intelligence documents pose a significant, complex challenge for Discord as they do for other online platforms – only authorized government personnel can determine whether a document is classified, unclassified, or even authentic. And currently, there is no structured process for the government to communicate their determinations to platforms like Discord. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, what is clear is that unauthorized disclosure of classified government documents violates Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, which prohibit the posting of illegal content on our platform. Because of this, in connection with this incident, we have removed content, terminated user accounts, and are cooperating with the efforts of the United States Departments of Defense and Justice in their investigation of this incident. And, while a suspect has been arrested, we continue to conduct our own internal investigation of these events.</p>
            <p>Discord is a communications platform that brings people together over shared experiences. More than 150 million people around the world use our platform every month to stay in touch and spend time with the most important people in their lives. </p>
            <p>The safety of all the people and communities that call Discord their online home is a top priority. Posting illegal content or demonstrating racist behavior, both observed in this incident, are not welcome or allowed on Discord. </p>
            <p>Below is a summary of what we can share about the recent incident, including actions taken and more details around our practices.</p>
