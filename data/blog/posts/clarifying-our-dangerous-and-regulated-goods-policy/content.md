            <p>Last week, we <a href="https://discord.com/blog/important-policy-updates">announced</a> updates to our <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339366295">Paid Services Terms</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, which go into effect March 27, 2023. In the updates to our Community Guidelines, we further clarified our policy on Dangerous and Regulated Goods, and introduced a new part of the guideline that required communities to apply an age-restricted label to any channels that contain the discussion of dangerous and regulated goods.</p>
            <p>The intention of this requirement is to ensure the safety of our users through preventing the promotion of dangerous or illegal activities, especially as it relates to teens on Discord. </p>
            <p>However, we are further evaluating how best to support our moderators and communities in regards to any new age-restricted policies. As such, this new requirement will not go into effect until we have provided more guidance and clarity, which will happen in the coming months.</p>
            <p>Below, we’ve gone a bit deeper into this rule to explain what is changing, what’s not, and what we classify as a Dangerous and Regulated Good. </p>
