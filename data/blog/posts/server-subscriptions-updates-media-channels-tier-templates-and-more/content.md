            <p>Since Server Subscriptions first launched <a href="https://discord.com/blog/server-and-creator-subscriptions">in December</a>, thousands of creators have started earning on Discord, offering unique perks and benefits which help engage and grow their communities. To date, we've paid out millions of dollars to thousands of creators and communities, and we're seeing more creators and communities earning on their Discord servers every day.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For creators and communities who haven’t tried out these features yet, we’ve heard your feedback: you want more ideas on what to offer, more tools to add value to your subscriptions, and the ability to sell different types of products on Discord.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
            <p><strong>Today, we’re excited to share new tools that help you get started earning money faster. Over the next few months, you’ll be able to create more value for your existing Server Subscriptions and utilize entirely new ways to earn money on Discord with one-time purchases.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Host intimate subscriber-only streams as a high value item for your community</strong>. Recently, we announced the addition of <a href="https://discord.com/blog/introducing-video-screen-share-text-chat-support-for-stage-channels">Video, Screen Sharing and Text in Voice in Stage Channels</a> and we’re already seeing communities offering a range of unique and intimate video streaming experiences for their Server Subscriptions, such as coaching sessions, Q&amp;A’s, or intimate weekly game streams. If you’re offering perks to your subscribers, it’s a good idea to ask your community for feedback from time to time to learn of their interests and customize your offerings accordingly. (They’re the ones paying, after all!)</p>

            <p>Still on the fence about launching Server Subscriptions for your community? Gain some inspiration from these stories about a few successful creators and communities that are earning with their Discord server.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Remember: Not every opportunity to generate revenue needs to become a get-rich-quick scheme. Some communities use their monetization offerings to reinvest back into their server by releasing new content, running more events, and providing memorable experiences for @everyone that are made possible by the income contributed by their most dedicated members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One example of this is Woohoojin, who’s created a chaotic yet charitable community in Club Banana. Check ‘em out below! </p>

            <h2><strong>New Ways to Earn on Discord Are On The Way: Server Shop, Downloadables and Premium Roles<br></strong></h2>
            <p>And sneak peek! Creators have expressed their desire to earn money on Discord in ways that go beyond recurring subscriptions<strong>. </strong>Over the coming months, we’ll begin experimenting with ways for server owners to sell digital products (like a recipe e-book, gaming guide or digital wallpaper) as a one-time purchase with <strong>Downloadables.</strong></p>
            <p>Currently available as part of Server Subscriptions, <strong>Premium Roles will soon be purchasable either standalone or bundled with your chosen Downloadables for a one-time purchase</strong>. With Premium Roles, creators can offer exclusive access with every purchase. Creators can make role-gate channels and perks, allowing customers to connect with each other and get support for their purchases.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>With all of these additional ways to earn on Discord, we’re also testing <strong>Server Shop</strong>, a single home for server owners to sell Server Subscriptions, Downloadables and Premium Roles.&nbsp;</p>
