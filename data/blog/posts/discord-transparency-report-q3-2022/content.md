            <p>Our mission at Discord is to give people the power to create belonging in their lives. We recognize that safety enables people to find belonging, and that’s why safety is one of our most important investments and priorities.</p>
            <p>Safety is a collaborative and cross-functional effort at Discord. Our Engineering, Data, and Product teams build products with safety principles in mind. Our Policy team takes a nuanced and sophisticated approach to developing our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> and forms strategic partnerships with academics, civil society, industry peers, and community moderators to advance our collective understanding of online safety. Our Safety team works with cutting-edge technology to detect and respond to abuse, both proactively and from reports received from users, moderators, and trusted third party reporters.</p>
            <p>Safety is a vital priority for our company. Around 15% of all Discord employees are dedicated to this area and every employee shares in the commitment to keeping Discord safe. Thes​​e <a href="https://discord.com/tags/transparency-reports">Transparency Reports</a> provide insight into our continued investment into keeping Discord a safe place for people to find belonging.</p>
            <p>This Transparency Report, our <a href="https://discord.com/tags/transparency-reports">ninth since 2019</a>, covers the third quarter of 2022, from July to September.<br>‍</p>

            <h2><strong>Community Guidelines Enforcement</strong></h2>
            <p>Discord publishes and maintains a comprehensive set of <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> that explains what content and behavior is and isn’t allowed on Discord. We invest heavily in our proactive efforts to detect and remove abuse before it’s reported to us. Through advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized teams, and partnering with external experts, we work to remove high-harm abuse before it is viewed or experienced by others.<br><br>We encourage users, moderators, and trusted reporters to submit reports if they believe an account or server is violating our Community Guidelines. We analyze these reports to determine if the content or behavior violates our Guidelines. We may take a number of enforcement actions including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; temporarily or permanently disabling or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible; and potentially reporting them to law enforcement.</p>
            <p>This report details the actions that Discord has taken on accounts and servers that have violated our Community Guidelines and <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Actions Taken on Accounts and Servers</strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Account and Server Warnings</strong></h3>
            <p>Discord issues warnings with the goal of preventing future violations of our Community Guidelines. For some high-harm issues such as Violent Extremism or Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) - a subcategory of Child Safety - we do not issue warnings but rather immediately disable the account and remove the content. In the case of CSAM, we also report the account to the <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a>.</p>

                <figcaption>The above chart breaks down warnings issued to individual accounts, servers, and server members. A text version of this chart is available <a href="https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-September-2022/blob/main/Q3%202022%20Transparency%20Report%20Data%20%20-%20Account%20and%20Server%20Warnings.csv">here</a>.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We issue two types of warnings for accounts: Individual Account Warnings, which are issued to individual users, and Server Member Warnings, which target multiple members of a server and may be issued when warning or removing a server from Discord.</p>
            <p>Individual accounts were issued <strong>17,809 </strong>warnings, an increase of 31% when compared to the previous quarter. The number of warnings issued to servers decreased by 11% to <strong>2,330</strong>, and warnings issued to server members decreased by 16.5% to <strong>1,290,964 </strong>accounts warned.</p>
            <h3><strong>Accounts Disabled</strong></h3>

            </figure>
            <p>We disabled <strong>185,756 </strong>accounts between July and September 2022 for policy violations not including spam, a 74.5% decrease when compared to 726,759 accounts disabled in the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>The Child Safety category accounted for 90% of this decrease in accounts disabled. This decline is a direct result of our ongoing improvements in our efforts to detect and proactively remove child exploitative content from Discord. Our ability to more rapidly detect networks of bad actors limits the number of accounts engaging with the content, resulting in fewer accounts disabled overall. An in-depth look at each of these categories, including Child Safety, can be found in the <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-transparency-report-q3-2022#heading-5">Enforcement Trend Analysis</a> of this report.</p>
            <p>Accounts disabled for spam or spam-related offenses increased to <strong>50,510,769</strong>.<strong> </strong>This is an increase of 82% from the previous quarter when we disabled 27,733,948 spam accounts. Our proactive anti-spam efforts continue to improve and become more sophisticated, creating a better user experience on Discord for all.</p>
            <h3><strong>Servers Removed</strong></h3>

            </figure>
            <p>We removed <strong>30,456 </strong>servers between July and September 2022, an increase of 7% from the 28,370 servers that we removed during the previous quarter.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We continue to invest in our ability to proactively detect and remove servers before they’re reported to us, especially for high-harm categories. We’re proud to share that 92% of servers removed for Child Safety were removed proactively, with CSAM servers being removed proactively 99% of the time. Overall, 71% of removed servers were removed proactively.</p>
            <h3><strong>Appeals</strong></h3>

            </figure>
            <p>Discord allows users to appeal actions taken on their accounts if they believe that the enforcement was incorrect.</p>
            <p>We welcome appeals and take them seriously when they raise context or information that we may not have known. We review appeals and reinstate accounts if we determine that a mistake was made, or if we believe, based on the appeal, that the user has recognized the violation made for a low-harm issue and will abide by our Community Guidelines once back on Discord. We received<strong> </strong>appeals from 15.5% of disabled accounts, or <strong>28,736 </strong>appeals. This was around the same percentage of appeals received during the previous quarter. From these appeals, we reinstated <strong>1,334</strong> accounts or 4.64% of users who submitted an appeal.<br>‍</p>

            <h2><strong>Enforcement Trend Analysis</strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Child Safety</strong></h3>
            <p>Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for anyone who endangers or sexualizes children. Child-harm content is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord or the internet at large. We work with industry peers, civil society, and law enforcement to ensure that this effort extends beyond Discord. Discord is an active supporter of cross-industry programs such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and is a member of the <a href="https://www.technologycoalition.org/what-we-do">Technology Coalition</a>, a group of companies together to end online child sexual exploitation and abuse. We’re also a frequent sponsor of events dedicated to increasing awareness of and action on child safety issues such as the annual Dallas Crimes Against Children Conference.</p>
            <p>We invest heavily in advanced tooling and <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044154611-Talking-about-online-safety-with-your-teen">education</a> so parents know how our service works and understand the controls that can contribute to creating a positive and safe experience on Discord for their children. As part of our <a href="https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work">ongoing commitment to parent engagement</a>, Discord is a proud sponsor of the <a href="https://www.pta.org">National Parent Teacher Association</a> and <a href="https://www.connectsafely.org">ConnectSafely</a>. We continue to be a member of the Family Online Safety Institute, contributing to and learning from its important work.</p>
            <p>Users who upload abuse material of children to Discord are reported to NCMEC and removed from the service. We deeply value our partnership with NCMEC and their efforts to ensure that grooming and endangerment cases are quickly escalated to law enforcement.</p>
            <p>In the third quarter of 2022, we reported <strong>14,366 </strong>accounts to NCMEC. 14,303 of those reports were media (images or videos), of which many were flagged through PhotoDNA – a tool that uses a shared industry hash database of known CSAM. 63 high-harm grooming or endangerment reports were also delivered to NCMEC.</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px">
                <div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/639103f21adaaa03180244e5_rGRt-QLBjj1BV1Yvi0JstjyTAHhuhRN1gNOTrRhDy77vZwqKlJFCQZMkgIClaTRnckE0p23eKj3SWFb9zvS0UaYNvHIEckMbI7Uc7bgxF_yHvtc3gFJSdDPvXxJR4h0L8Fy16MvriYzn36peQwkjw1lHygGDMR3xUNgU_jTjTTJ3EJjHHWxPK-ihFmwoCg.png" alt=""></div>
                <figcaption>A text version of the reports filed to NCMEC chart is available <a href="https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-September-2022/blob/main/Q3%202022%20Transparency%20Report%20Data%20%20-%20NCMEC.csv">here</a>.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Discord disabled <strong>42,458 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>14,451 </strong>servers for Child Safety during the third quarter of 2022. This was a 92% decrease in the number of accounts disabled when compared to the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>Our investment and prioritization in Child Safety has never been more robust. These decreases are the result of improvements in our efforts to detect and proactively remove child exploitative content from Discord. Specifically, better operating procedures and enhanced detection capabilities have enabled our team to identify these servers faster.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>By targeting and proactively removing networks of bad actors from Discord before they grew in size, fewer accounts participated in these spaces, and as a result, fewer accounts were disabled.</p>
            <p>We were able to remove servers hosting CSAM content proactively <strong>99% </strong>of the time. Removing CSAM content is one of our top priorities, and we are proud of the cross-functional efforts that have enabled us to achieve this proactive takedown rate for CSAM.</p>
            <h3><strong>Deceptive Practices</strong></h3>
            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of distributing malware, sharing or selling game hacks or cheats, theft of authentication tokens, or participating in identity, investment, and financial scams is a violation of our Community Guidelines.</p>
            <p>We disabled <strong>8,800 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>2,137 </strong>servers for Deceptive Practices during the third quarter of 2022. This was an increase of 43% and 27% respectively.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>Exploitative and Unsolicited Content</strong></h3>
            <p>It is a violation of our Community Guidelines to share or promote sexually explicit content of other people without their consent.</p>
            <p>We disabled <strong>47,570 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>1,837 </strong>servers<strong> </strong>for Exploitative and Unsolicited Content. This represents a 55% decrease in accounts disabled and a 21% decrease in servers removed when compared to the previous quarter.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This decrease was driven by our ability to identify and remove a specific abuse pattern, resulting in a decrease of servers created to host that content, and consequently, fewer accounts disabled for engaging with that content.</p>
            <h3><strong>Harassment and Bullying</strong></h3>
            <p>Harassment and bullying have no place on Discord. Continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments, circumventing bans, suggestive or overt threats, the sharing of someone’s personally identifiable information (also known as doxxing), and server raiding are violations of our Community Guidelines.</p>
            <p>During the third quarter of 2022, <strong>11,347 </strong>accounts were disabled for harassment-related behavior, and <strong>555</strong> servers were removed for this issue.</p>
            <h3><strong>Hateful Conduct</strong></h3>
            <p>Discord doesn’t allow the organization, promotion, or participation in hate speech or hateful conduct. We define “hate speech” as any form of expression that denigrates, vilifies, or dehumanizes; promotes intense, irrational feelings of enmity or hatred; or incites harm against people on the basis of protected characteristics. You can<a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-policy-updates-2022"> read our latest policy blog post</a> to learn more.</p>
            <p>During the third quarter of 2022,<strong> 7,104 </strong>accounts and <strong>829</strong> servers were removed for hateful conduct. Compared to the previous quarter, this was an increase of 24% and 16%, respectively.</p>
            <h3><strong>Identity and Authenticity</strong></h3>
            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of coordinating and participating in malicious impersonation of individuals or organizations is a violation of our Community Guidelines.</p>
            <p>We disabled<strong> 3,561 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>13</strong> servers for this issue. This was a significant increase as we continue to improve our methods&nbsp; for detecting and removing malicious bots.</p>
            <h3><strong>Misinformation</strong></h3>
            <p>In February 2022, we published a blog post discussing our new policy prohibiting the sharing of false or misleading information on Discord that is likely to cause physical or societal harm. <a href="https://discord.com/blog/addressing-health-misinformation">This blog post</a> discusses the new policy and our enforcement criteria in more detail.</p>
            <p>We disabled<strong> 385 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>52 </strong>servers for misinformation.</p>
            <h3><strong>Platform Manipulation</strong></h3>
            <p>Spam, fake accounts, and self-bots are examples of platform manipulation that damage the experience of our users and violate our Community Guidelines.</p>
            <p>During the third quarter of 2022, <strong>1,197 </strong>accounts and <strong>656</strong> servers were removed for platform manipulation-related issues not related to spam. An additional <strong>50,510,769 </strong>accounts were disabled for spam or spam-related offenses.</p>
            <p>We're focused on combating spam and minimizing users’ exposure to spammers and spam content on Discord. We have a dedicated cross-functional anti-spam team building sophisticated anti-spam measures, and as a result of this work, 90% of accounts disabled for spam were disabled proactively, before we received any user report.</p>
            <p>You can read more about how Discord fights spam <a href="https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-is-fighting-spam">here</a>. You can also read <a href="https://discord.com/blog/new-anti-spam-raid-automod-safety-update">this blog post</a> published in September about Automod, a new safety feature that enables server owners to automatically moderate certain abuse, including spam.</p>
            <h3><strong>Regulated or Illegal Activities</strong></h3>
            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of engaging in regulated, illegal, or dangerous activities is strictly prohibited, including selling or facilitating the sale of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods or services.</p>
            <p>We disabled <strong>37,284 </strong>accounts for engaging in this behavior, an increase of 35.5% from the prior quarter. A total of <strong>6,950 </strong>servers were removed for this category with a proactive removal rate of 63%.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>Self-Harm Concerns</strong></h3>
            <p>Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstance. We recently expanded our Self Harm Encouragement and Promotion Policy which you can read more about <a href="https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20allow%20any,help%20for%20self%2Dharm%20behaviors">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Actions may be taken on accounts or servers encouraging people to cut themselves or embrace eating disorders, or otherwise manipulating and coercing other users to engage in acts of self-harm. These actions are only taken on accounts glorifying or promoting acts of self-harm, not on users seeking help or in need of medical attention.</p>
            <p>In September we announced a new partnership with <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org">Crisis Text Line</a>, a nonprofit that provides 24/7 text-based mental health support and crisis intervention via trained volunteer crisis counselors. Crisis Text Line is currently available to those in the United States and is offered in both English and Spanish. You can read more about this partnership <a href="https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work">here</a>.</p>
            <p>We disabled <strong>1,297 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>610 </strong>servers for Self-Harm concerns.</p>
            <h3><strong>Violent and Graphic Content</strong></h3>
            <p>Real media depicting gore, excessive violence, the glorification of violence, or animal cruelty with the intent to harass or shock others is not allowed on Discord.</p>
            <p>In the third quarter of 2022, <strong>12,300 </strong>accounts<strong> </strong>were disabled for posting violent and graphic content. We also removed <strong>1,313 </strong>servers<strong> </strong>for violent and graphic content.</p>
            <h3><strong>Violent Extremism</strong></h3>
            <p>We consider violent extremism to be the support, encouragement, promotion, or organization of violent acts or ideologies that advocate for the destruction of society, often by blaming certain individuals or groups and calling for violence against them.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><a href="https://discord.com/blog/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord">This blog post</a> discusses our methods to address violent extremism. Through partnering and engaging in cross-industry work with Tech Against Terrorism, the Global Internet Forum To Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), the European Union Internet Forum, and other organizations, we’ve made progress in our tooling, policy, and subject matter expertise to ensure that violent extremism does not have a home on Discord.</p>
            <p>In the third quarter of 2022, <strong>12,489 </strong>accounts and <strong>1,053 </strong>servers were removed for violent extremism.<br>‍</p>

            <p>Law enforcement must provide valid legal documentation for the requested information. We review each information request to ensure legal compliance.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Discord may also disclose user data to law enforcement in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is an imminent risk of serious physical injury or death. You can read more about how Discord works with law enforcement <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044157931-Working-with-law-enforcement">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><strong>Legal Requests</strong></h3>
            <p>Discord received <strong>1,450 </strong>pieces<strong> </strong>of legal process during the third quarter of 2022, finding <strong>1,342</strong> both legally valid and specific enough for us to identify an account and produce relevant information. We work to limit disclosures of user information and content so they match the specific circumstances dictated by each request.</p>
