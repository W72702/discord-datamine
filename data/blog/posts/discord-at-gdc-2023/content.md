            <p>Discord is in the city! Kind of ‚Äî we‚Äôll be in <em>a</em> city. It‚Äôs a big city, and maybe you‚Äôre near it?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Next week, <strong>Discord will be in attendance at the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC)</strong> near our neck of the woods in <strong>San Francisco, California</strong>. If you‚Äôre planning to attend GDC 2023 in person, we‚Äôd love to have you swing by the <a href="https://discord.com/gdc-2023">booth</a> and say hi!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Buuuut if you‚Äôre enjoying GDC digitally or didn‚Äôt have plans to begin with, we‚Äôve got plenty of ways you can still get involved, whether it‚Äôs at the show or on Discord itself. Alongside our on-site shenanigans, we‚Äôll be doing cool stuff like showing off the latest Activities, releasing a new line of developer-themed Discord merch, and providing a space for current and aspiring devs around the world together.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Join us and experience Discord at GDC, no matter where you are!</p>

            <h2><strong>Try Out New Activities, Both at GDC and On The Go<br></strong></h2>
            <p>This week, there were some big updates to <a href="https://discord.com/blog/server-activities-games-voice-watch-together">Activities</a>. If you haven‚Äôt tried ‚Äòem out yet, Activities are casual games and shared experiences you can enjoy in any Voice channel at the press of a button. Hop into a Voice channel, hit the green Rocket button and you and your friends can quickly start an Activity together!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Alongside the game ‚ÄúGartic Phone‚Äù joining the Activities lineup, we also announced mobile support for Activities, letting you enjoy all your favorite Discord Activities with your friends, whether you‚Äôre at your desk or at a desk but the desk is actually grass and you‚Äôre at the park.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Before you venture out to the great outdoors to play some Chess in the Park on your mobile device, come swing by our GDC booth and try out any of our available Activities!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you end up being a bonafide Bobble League expert on all things, we‚Äôll be running <strong>Activity Tournaments during GDC</strong>. Sign up in the GDC server and compete in a variety of different Activities throughout the week!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just like the in-app experience, we‚Äôre providing a space for anyone to drop in and out as they please, letting you explore the selection of Activities at your own pace. They also provide a great method of stress relief if your GDC schedule is completely booked up and you need a minute to unwind.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you like ‚Äòem a <em>whole lot</em>, consider grabbing yourself some Discord Nitro, which gets you access to every Activity on both desktop and mobile, plus plenty more perks ‚Äî learn more about everything Nitro has to offer <a href="https://discord.com/nitro">here</a>.<br>‚Äç</p>
