            <h3>Attention, @everyone</h3>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>‍<strong>Usernames are evolving.</strong> Over the coming weeks, we will be inviting everyone on Discord (yep, even you) to update to a new username format that will be easier to remember and share with friends. Instead of having a discriminator (the #0001 number), usernames will be entirely unique. You can keep your display name as it is today or choose a wild and crazy one to better express yourself. When it’s your turn to update, we’ll let you know. <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">Learn more about this change</a>.</li>

                <li>‍<strong>Wumpus Wonderventures Webtoon. </strong>Say that three times fast. To celebrate our awesome fans, we made a webcomic featuring Wumpus and other Discord friends on an adventure. For a limited time, as a reward for your wholesome obsession with Wumpus, you can find and redeem a free 1-month Nitro code (some restrictions apply).

                <li><strong>Discord’s 8th birthday afterparty continues.</strong> In case you missed it: new drops in the <a href="https://discordmerch.com/dxcbl">merch store</a>: the <em>*DISXCORE*</em> collection, Elgato stream kits, plushies, just tons of cute stuff.</li>

                <li>‍<strong>Say more with voice messages.</strong> These were a hit in DMs and small servers, so we are adding them to larger servers. Admins who love silence can <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/13091096725527-Voice-Messages-#h_01GY0QJKCN13FJ6QXWXS6HD8BV">turn this off </a>if they wish.<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Sound off with soundboard.**</strong> Make your voice hangout a little more interesting with duck quacks, throat singing, the Vine boom, or any <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12612888127767-Soundboard-FAQ">sounds curated by your community</a>. Please airhorn responsibly.<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Stickers by Discord are now free for all.</strong> Our Wumpus, Mallow, and Choco sticker sets will soon be available to everyone.<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>New members get a warmer welcome. </strong>Community managers, you can now set up a simple quiz for new members to automatically assign channels and roles. People who join your Capybara Cleanliness Club server will spend less time figuring out how to get perms, and more time admiring pics of a capybara taking a hot bath. So cute…anyway, check out the <a href="http://https//discord.com/community/community-onboarding">blog</a> to learn more.<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Embedded channel links now look like embedded channel links. </strong>If you’ve ever copied the permalink to a channel or message (half of you reading can probably skip this at this point) and shared it, it probably wasn’t exactly exciting to see a long link with no context about where it was from. We made it so now you know where it takes you.&nbsp;<br>‍</li>
