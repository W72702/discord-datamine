            <p>🎂🎂🎂🎊🎊<strong> We are EIGHT YEARS OLD TODAY!</strong> <strong>(WOW) </strong>🎊🎊🎂🎂🎂&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Eight years of gathering with your friends on Discord and spending time together. You’ve been getting a few rounds of your favorite game in, discussing which fan-ship from that anime you’re obsessed with is best, or staying up late into the night in Voice with your best friends. At this rate, we’ll qualify for a senior discount at the local deli… mmm, corned beef…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Between May 15–June 15, we’re celebrating our eighth Discord birthday, and you’re invited! (Yeah, <strong>YOU</strong>!) Read on to see what’s in store for our birthday celebrations.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>For a whole month starting on our birthday, everyone is invited to enjoy any of our Activities for free, even if you aren’t currently a Nitro member.</strong> Because what’s better than celebrating by playing games with your friends over Discord?

            <p>Just made some new friends and don’t share a mutual server with them to enjoy Activities in? <strong>Now, you can launch and enjoy Activities while in a voice call in DMs and Group DMs</strong> using the rocketship (🚀) button while in a call, just like you can in a server’s Voice channel<strong>.</strong> If you’ve found yourself in a debate that can only be solved with a good ol’ Chess duel, hop on a private call with your friend in a DM and play there instead of on a server.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Never played an Activity before and wanna see what’s possible? Head on over to either our Activities blog post to see what’s available or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord">the support article</a> for the real nitty-gritty info.<strong> Don’t forget: Activities are now available on mobile</strong>, so you’ll always be ready to battle it out in Blazing 8s.</p>

            <h2><strong>Nitro Members Can Celebrate Birthday With Special Perks<br></strong></h2>
            <p>Your friends are together in Voice, playing Sketch Heads, blaring some party airhorns using Soundboard, and using Reactions in Voice to cover your screen in 🎉 emojis … the only thing that’s missing is your trusty Personal Party Equipment (PPE for short).&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>During our birthday celebration, </strong><a href="https://discord.com/nitro"><strong>Nitro</strong></a><strong> members can join the party in style with a new set of Avatar Decorations</strong>. Head to <strong>User Settings &gt; Profiles</strong> on either desktop or mobile and choose from a selection of snazzy new decorations, such as headphones, space-ready helmets, and a HUD interface to make yourself look like you’re piloting a mech.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Birthday parties aren’t complete without gifting something to the friends you care about. That’s why, <strong>Nitro members can share a special two-week trial of Discord Nitro with up to three of their soon-to-be-lucky friends</strong>!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If one of your friends is eligible for a Nitro trial, you’ll see a new Nitro-shaped button when you go to talk to them in DMs. Select that, and you can offer them one of your three free trials. They’ll be able to use the special birthday avatar decorations and try out our newest features like Super Reactions, Color Themes, and more.</p>
            <p>Both of these Nitro perks are around for a full month, and will end on June 15.</p>

            <h2><strong>An Emoji Birthday Gift to @everyone from Riot Games<br></strong></h2>
            <p>Discord is home to a seemingly endless amount of community spaces big and small that help make people feel like they have a place to call home on the platform. It probably sounds pretty obvious saying this out loud, but a good chunk of these servers involve gaming with your friends late into the night.</p>
            <p>Our buddies at Riot Games are offering @everyone <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/discord-riot-games-emotes">a special set of Riot-themed Discord emojis</a> that anyone can download and add to their servers. They’re based on characters from Riot's own games, so you’ll likely recognize a few faces if you play any of their games. Even if you don’t play any games at all, they’re still <em>really</em> adorable emojis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
