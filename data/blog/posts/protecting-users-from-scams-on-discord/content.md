            <p><br>So you’re about to click the link to join that server and grab that sweet, new drop. But you notice something’s not right. The link looks right but something seems…off. You notice their speaking patterns aren’t the most human. They claim you did things you know you have never done. They seem in a rush and are warning you that you gotta get in on what they’re offering fast or you’ll lose out. They never posted in any of your mutual servers, or don’t even share mutual servers with you, but they want to speak to YOU. </p>
            <p>You might have heard about scams like this happening on Discord recently. Or it might have even happened to you. <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-scam-ftc-2079c3b2-6237-4ff8-92f2-d08382cd0d70.html">You're not alone, and it’s not just Discord—the FTC says online scams surged in 2021</a>. Our mission has always been to make Discord the best place on the internet for people to find belonging and we’re amazed to see all the different interests that have brought communities together, from study sessions to NFT drops, and even houseplant care. But we’ve also seen some unfriendly characters try to exploit those communities. </p>
            <p>So we want to share some of the additional measures we’re taking on our end and go over ways you can protect yourself and others on Discord. You may already know some of these tips and tricks, but a refresher never hurts. &nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>This is in no way an exhaustive list</strong>. It’s an unfortunate reality that bad actors online will change and evolve their tactics, but so can you. We encourage you to check in with your existing internet safety skills and incorporate the following practices in your online habits if you haven’t done so already.</p>
            <p>While we hope you take the time to read the finer details below, we also wanted to provide a TLDR; some cliff notes to keep in your back pocket: <br></p>
            <p><strong>For everyone:</strong></p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li><em>Don’t click links from unknown senders or that look suspicious.</em></li>
                <li><em>Don’t download programs or copy/paste code you don't recognize.</em></li>
                <li><em>Don’t give your password to anyone!</em></li>
                <li><em>Never share or screenshare your authorization token. Seriously. Don't do it.</em></li>
                <li><em>Don’t scan any QR codes from people you don’t know or those you can’t verify as legitimate.</em></li>
                <li><em>Enable 2-Factor Authentication to keep your account as safe as possible. </em><a href="https://discord.com/blog/keeping-discord-safe-and-sound"><em>Check out our 2FA blog for more details on getting this set up. </em></a></li>
                <li><em>Consider restricting who can DM with you. </em><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings-"><em>You can learn how to do this here.</em></a><strong><br></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For server owners and mods:</strong></p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li><em>Audit your server Permissions, especially for higher-level tools like webhooks.</em></li>
                <li><em>Keep your official server invites updated and visible across all your platforms when any changes are made, especially if the majority of your new server members come from communities outside of Discord. </em></li>
                <li><em>Again, don’t click suspicious or unknown links! If your account gets compromised, it can have greater effects on communities you moderate.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are always working behind the scenes to keep Discord safe, but we need your help too! Here are two safety checklists and another article listing common scams to brush up on your defenses—help us make these tips common knowledge for everyone!</p>
