            <p>We’d call that a friend, of course! Friends are a big part of making your Discord experience unforgettable — which is why we’ve written this helpful blog post to explain how they work. <br><br>(Well, how our Friends List works…not your IRL friends…)</p>

            <h2><strong>What does being Discord friends mean?</strong></h2>
            <p>Well, for one thing, it means you’re on each other’s Friends lists — that’s like, friends-for-life right there. You’ll show up on each other’s Active Now tabs and Home screens, and will be able to see each other’s online status when you’re in the same group DM, making it easier to keep track of when they’re online and what they’re up to.</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600pxpx">

                <figcaption>Your first friend!&nbsp;</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>‍<br>It’ll also be a little easier to interact overall. Friends can always direct message each other, even if someone’s privacy settings would normally block DMs from non-Friends. Friends can also freely add each other to group DMs. If you end up getting placed in a Group DM out of the blue, it’s guaranteed that at least one of your friends was in that conversation beforehand.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>

            <h2><strong>How to find (and make) friends on Discord</strong></h2>
            <p>If you want to meet a kindred spirit on Discord, just ask yourself: where would <em>you </em>want to hang out? Consider taking a cruise through Server Discovery to scope out a new community to join.&nbsp;</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600pxpx">

                <figcaption>Use the search bar to find the perfect community for you.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Don’t be shy about joining smaller servers, either—it can be hard to connect with new people when chat moves a mile a minute, so try some cozier spaces.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As for more specific advice, that’s really down to where you are and who you’re hanging out with. Maybe you jumped into a random raid group in a gaming server and hit it off with some cool folks. Or maybe you helped a nice stranger work out why their cacti aren’t flowering. If the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYbbfbUnEI">vibe’s right</a>, go ahead and Add Friend! They just might accept your request.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Remember: common interests bring Discord communities together. If you took the time to join a particular Discord server, then you’ve likely already got things in common with its inhabitants! Maybe they’ll even invite you to some other communities they enjoy, where you meet more friends until you have someone to talk to for any subject or situation.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Simple! Just head to <strong>Settings &gt; Friend Requests</strong>. You’ll see some helpful settings such as these:</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

            <p>These are the same Privacy Settings we hinted at <a href="https://discord.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-discord-friends#heading-6">in the question regarding being unable to message friends</a>. You can limit who can send you a Friend Request to just Friends of Friends, Server Members only, both of those options simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can also open the floodgates and allow “Everyone” to send you a friend request, which will allow anyone who knows your username to send you a Friend Request.&nbsp;</p>
