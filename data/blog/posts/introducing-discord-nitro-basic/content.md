            <p>We first launched the Nitro subscription over five years ago to give our users more ways to have fun and express themselves on Discord. Since then, we’ve been working hard to grow and improve Nitro by adding new perks like HD streaming, stickers, per-server profiles, and tons more.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As people across the world continue to make their homes on Discord, the way people use the platform to spend time with their friends and communities has evolved too. We want to expand our Nitro offerings to better serve the needs of our growing user base.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That’s why today, we’re excited to announce our latest addition to the Nitro family: <a href="https://discord.com/nitro"><strong>Nitro Basic</strong></a>. Our newest plan includes some of Nitro’s most-loved features, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
