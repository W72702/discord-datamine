            <p>There are so many amazingly fun and wonderfully weird things happening on Discord at any given time. And it’s these unique experiences that bring people together around shared interests within their favorite communities on Discord.</p>
            <p>One of the most popular behaviors we’re seeing on our platform is the use of ✨ <strong>emojis ✨</strong>. Emojis are often used to convey both simple and complex messages, and their widespread use has cemented them into a universal language anyone can speak. With over 75% of Discord users living outside the U.S., these icons have become vital for communication on Discord 🔑:</p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>Users across the globe share on average over 4.3 billion emojis each week with their Discord communities.</li>
                <li>Since Discord first launched in 2015, people have sent over 291 billion emojis and reacted to messages with 145 billion emojis.</li>
                <li>In the past 365 days alone, an average of over 455,000 emojis were used on Discord <em>every minute</em><strong> </strong>– that’s over 7,600 emojis used every second!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To further understand the magic behind emojis – both on and off Discord – we surveyed 16,000 people around the world 🌎 to understand why they’re beloved by so many.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>What did we learn?</strong> 🤔💡</p>
            <p>Emojis are essential to ensuring good, effective communication, particularly among Gen Z. These tiny pictures are worth thousands of words – they help people feel accepted and understood by others, and allow self-expression in a way text just can’t convey. Emojis also connect people and communities globally, boost self-confidence, and cultivate friendships. 👫</p>
            <p>But don’t take our word for it! We enlisted the help of our industry partners, <strong>Neil Cohn Ph.D.</strong>, a cognitive scientist who’s internationally recognized for his pioneering research on the relationship between visual communication and language, and <strong>Connor Blakley</strong>, founder and CEO of YouthLogic and considered “The #1 Gen Z Expert to Follow” by Forbes, to help us better understand how emojis are central to modern communication across generations.</p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at the data 📈and see what our industry experts have to say! 🤓💭</p>

            <p><strong>Emojis are the Secret to Building Connection, Trust, and Togetherness Online. </strong>No matter who you’re speaking to, or where your conversation is taking place, emojis are the secret sauce to building connection, trust, and togetherness online – 63% of people surveyed say emojis help them connect with interest-based communities, while 73% feel emojis help bring people together.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Emojis also help strengthen connections and relationships with friends, family, significant others, love interests, classmates, and coworkers. Next time you’re talking to your mom 👩🏽, boss 👨🏿‍💻, or favorite Discord community member 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, consider throwing in a few emojis!&nbsp;</p>

            </figure>
            <p><strong>Younger Generations are Likely to Feel More Honest, Expressive, and Comfortable Using Emojis. </strong>Younger generations are often digital natives and for this reason, may have a better understanding of what emojis bring to a conversation. They can also help explain the proper use of even the most cryptic emojis. 🙃🤠&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Globally, Gen Z (61%) and Millennials (68%) believe that texts with emojis allow them to be more honest compared to texts without them, and Gen Z (65%) and Millennials (69%) can communicate their feelings better through emojis than written messages.</p>
            <blockquote>“As Gen Z begins to lead culture as a whole, we are seeing their impact on older generations. Parents of Gen Z kids are finding connection by literally ‘speaking their language’ – including emoji use. This is because, for Gen Z, emojis do things that words can’t. Texting can feel impersonal, but emojis let you put some of yourself into the conversation.” – CONNOR BLAKLEY</blockquote>

            <p><strong>Emojis are Taking Over Written Language. </strong>Emojis offer greater personal expression, sometimes even more than written or verbal words. While 57% of people say they can better express their personality through emojis than through words, 70% say emojis can help make messages clearer. 😎🤏😳🕶🤏</p>
            <blockquote>“Gen Z craves authentic ways to show up as themselves in digital communities, which is why Discord is the go-to for Gen Z. With endless emoji options available – from characters from your favorite IP to community-specific references and jokes – using custom emojis allow my generation to feel truly at home in the digital world.” – CONNOR BLAKLEY</blockquote>

            <p><strong>Emojis are More Powerful Than Likes. </strong>Sharing our thoughts, actions, and interests is a common aspect of online culture. However, with sharing often comes the desire for validation. And emojis may be the new, preferred way to co-sign virtually: 57% of people get a bigger confidence boost when receiving emojis than a Like on a photo, and 43% say emojis provide more validation than a text or verbal statement.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A boost in confidence can be a powerful feeling, and providing that feeling to another person may be as easy as sending an emoji. 😍🔥👑</p>

            <p><strong>Emojis are Key to Making Digital Communication More Human. </strong>With the rise of virtual communication, the nuances of in-person conversations are often lost, creating confusion and misunderstanding.

            <blockquote>“Within the digital domain, emojis are the alternative to being able to see each other’s faces, and in turn provide a certain sense of clarity and sentiment that text simply cannot. This can help us feel closer to each other and better navigate challenging conversations.” – NEIL COHN&nbsp;</blockquote>

            <p><em>Discord surveyed 16,000 people aged 16+ in the US, Brazil, UK, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Australia to uncover how emojis are essential to self-expression and togetherness in digital communication. The survey was conducted from August 16 – September 7, 2022. Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in The Harris Poll surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within + 1.2 percentage points using a 95% confidence level, and certain questions were asked among a reduced base of emoji users. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.</em></p>
