            <p>Reactions: they say the stuff we just can’t put into words. Want to agree with your friend without saying “^ this” in chat? Slap a “✅” on that bad boy. But sometimes, a small emoji just isn’t enough.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Take a look at this for instance:</p>

            <p>Your favorite 🗿 is just there. Chillin’. Doing nothing after being placed down on a message. It, like the mystical statue the emoji is modeled after, is completely motionless. It doesn’t have the “oomph” that you wanted to convey when it was placed there, and it doesn’t bring the sheer EMOTION that 🗿 needs to bring to the conversation.</p>
            <p>Enter one of our newest Nitro perks: <strong>Super Reactions</strong>. <br></p>

            <p>Rolling out on desktop starting today, Super Reactions bring an extra burst of energy and spirit to hype up chat when you need it the most. Whether you want to recognize a friend who did something really rad, highlight a certain post to have it stand out from the pack, or just <em>really really</em> agree with someone, make your reactions burst to life using a Super Reaction.</p>

            <h2><strong><br>How to use Super Reactions with Discord Nitro</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Subscribers to any tier of Nitro will be able to use Super Reactions</strong> on server messages. When you do, your emoji reaction will pop up on the page with a fun animation.</p>
            <p>Don’t have Nitro yet but wanna try out Super Reactions? <strong>Everyone will receive 2 Super Reactions to get started, even if you don’t have Nitro.</strong> Use ‘em to their fullest, and if you really like using them, consider checking out <a href="https://discord.com/nitro">Nitro</a> sometime — we think you’ll like it a lot.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>‍<strong>Any of your emojis can be used as a Super Reaction</strong>: That in-joke emoji of your friend’s face after eating a whole lemon? Super-Lemon. Your favorite streamer’s pog emoji? Super-Pog. The incredibly low-resolution animated emoji that’s actually a 15-minute video clip you managed to shove into the 256 KB emoji file limit? You’re obligated to sit through the whole thing now.&nbsp;</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:550pxpx">
                <div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/642c933caf13e768b3a6ed33_xjLKiNNJfAmRqkMYqODxXnZbO_NN55vut7XX19n0slfdZziT2Q8QvCr003ZA0uJjI43ju0M1dePMb-xI5cMqgSzfrneLdYvIVlyajmxTIlSZy16s70zFIp7brD7y1rGfxO880TXHF6bgCtdrHRPYomk.gif" alt="A Super Reaction in action, utilizing the Pulsing Heart emoji. The heart bursts out of the screen!"></div>
            </figure>
            <p>You’re probably thinking to yourself: “Wait, I can add a Super Reaction to ANY message? Wouldn’t all these messages get bombarded with confetti and decoration if every reaction can be animated?” Well, with great abilities comes… uh… being reasonable with it, I think is the right phrase.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Anyways, it’s all about using your Super Reactions responsibly: <strong>Discord Nitro members get to use 5 Super Reactions per week, and Nitro Basic or Nitro Classic members will get to use 2 per week.</strong> When next week rolls around, you’ll get another batch of Super Reactions to use, and the Super Reactions you didn’t get to use last week will roll over. Save ‘em up, buy a horse!</p>

                <figcaption>When selecting a Reaction, you’ll see a new Super Reaction option. Selecting a Super Reaction works just like a normal Reaction.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When you see a message that truly needs that extra <em>oomph</em>, give it a Super Reaction and show your appreciation, but be thoughtful: <strong>if you use a Super Reaction and decide to remove it later on, you won’t get it back.</strong> (It’s “Super <em>Reaction</em>,” not “Super <em>Retraction</em>”, after all.) In addition, you can’t use ‘em in DMs or Group DMs — they’re for use on servers only, where many friends can enjoy their beauty!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And be nice about using your Super Reactions! If a community admin in the server you used your Super Reaction thinks your reaction usage wasn’t in-line with their rules, they can use their moderator powers to remove your Super Reaction, just like any other reaction. You can also remove it yourself, but in either scenario, you won’t get your credit returned once it’s removed.&nbsp;</p>
