            <p>While millions of people around the world use Discord, in reality, it’s just a (really good) product with the tools to help people talk. What makes Discord truly special are the people who use it to foster communities where everyone feels like they have a place to call home.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For this year’s Black History Month, we’re sharing a handful of exemplary communities on the platform that embody our mantra of trying to create a world where everyone has a place to belong. The following servers were sourced through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5309276245271-Discord-Admin-Community-FAQ">Discord Admin Community</a> and recommended by Discord’s Black and African American Movement Employee Resource Group — or the BAAM ERG for short.<br>‍</p>

            <h2><strong>Season: A Letter to the Future</strong></h2>
            <p>You may have heard of Season: A Letter to the Future, a newly-released exploration game with a heavy focus on its story and taking things at your own pace with your trusty bicycle. Developed by Scavengers Studio, who describe themselves as a “small indie company with a diverse and inclusive team.”&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The game’s verified Discord server is home to those looking for people to talk to during their journey through the game’s secluded village. The game stars a Black female protagonist who logs everything she discovers about the world in her trusty journal — the Scavengers Studio team says their game’s official Discord community is full of “so many POC who are thrilled to see themselves represented.”&nbsp;</p>
