            <p>We believe a safer internet is an internet where more people can find belonging. For Discord, safety is a common good. We want to make not just our platform, but the rest of the internet, a better and safer place.</p>
            <p>Here at Discord, we recognize our responsibility in creating a safer internet but we can't do it alone. That’s why this year we’ve partnered with local online safety advocacy organizations like NoFiltr to create education content to help users stay safe on Discord and the internet as a whole and develop healthy digital habits in celebration of Safer Internet Day.</p>
