            <p>Whether it’s a Discord server dedicated to the work of a certain content creator or a community that gathers around a particular topic, these server owners take their time to facilitate conversation, connection, and creativity in their environments. Now, it’s time to support them back.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Starting today, we’re expanding the availability of Server Subscriptions, allowing creators on Discord to earn money directly within their server. </strong>Creators and community leaders will be able to offer subscription plans in exchange for unique roles, perks, and benefits.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And like the best features on Discord, it’s totally up to creators and community leaders on how they utilize it: from pricing to offerings, <strong>server owners can set up their Server Subscriptions how they like while taking home 90% of the money they </strong><strong>earn</strong> after applicable deductions.</p>
            <p>Unsure of how Server Subscriptions can benefit your existing or soon-to-be-started Discord server? Our new <a href="http://www.discord.com/creators">Creator Portal</a> helps you take your community to new heights; enjoy lessons, find inspiration and launch your Server Subscription with ease.</p>
            <p>You’ll even be able to share your server subscription offerings outside of your Discord community! <a href="https://discord.com/creators/say-hello-to-promo-pages-our-new-server-subscriptions-feature">Promo pages</a> allow you to create a sharable webpage to promote all your Server Subscription has to offer, even outside of Discord, and they’re rolling out starting today.<br>‍</p>

            <h2><strong>Today, Server Subscription Eligibility Expands Across the US&nbsp;</strong></h2>
            <p><a href="https://discord.com/blog/building-sustainable-creator-communities-on-discord">Over the last year</a>, we’ve been testing a new way for creators and community leaders to make money directly on Discord by providing exclusive experiences, available only for their paying subscribers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We’re excited to share that beginning today, Server Subscriptions is making its official debut, and all existing servers on Discord that meet the minimum requirements can now monetize their server. Subscriptions can range from $2.99 - $199.99 in price. Within the settings tab of your server, under the Monetization category simply enable Server Subscriptions to begin creating your subscriber offerings.</p>
            <p>To enable Server Subscriptions, your server needs to meet the following requirements:<br></p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>The server owner must be based in the United States</li>
                <li>Your server has a good standing with Discord, meaning no recent Terms of Service or Community Guideline violations</li>
                <li>You must agree to our updated <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Creator-Pilot-Terms#:~:text=They%20include%20requirements%20such%20as,Don't%20harm%20Discord.">Monetization Terms</a> and <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983">Server Subscriptions Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Looking for some inspiration on how to implement your own Server Subscriptions like the ones above? We have just the example for you! Bella Poarch is using Server Subscriptions to give her members three extra tiers of goodness:</p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>Tier 1 (priced at $2.99 a month) includes an exclusive monthly video and unlocks access to features in her server, like creating public threads.</li>
                <li>Tier 2 (priced at $4.99 a month) gives subscribers exclusive voting rights on polls and early access to future merch drops, plus everything from tier one!</li>
                <li>Tier 3 (priced at $9.99 a month) grants access to never-before-seen behind the scenes content and all of the amazing perks from the previous two tiers.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
