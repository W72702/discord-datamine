            <h2><strong>Linking Your Account for PlayStation Network to Discord&nbsp;</strong></h2>
            <p>If you’ve ever linked an external Connection to your Discord profile before or gained yourself a snazzy <a href="https://discord.com/blog/connected-accounts-functionality-boost-linked-roles">Linked Role</a> in a community you frequent, it’s a similar method to connect your account for PlayStation Network to your Discord account.</p>
            <p>First, make sure your PS5 is fully up to date with the latest system software. Not sure how? <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/">Learn how to update your PS5 here</a>.</p>
            <p>To start connecting your accounts on Discord, head into <strong>User Settings &gt; Connections</strong> on either desktop, web, or mobile. Select the PlayStation logo within the Connections menu and follow the process to get your account for PlayStation Network linked to your Discord account! It looks kinda like this:</p>

            <p>Once you sign in and link your accounts, you're all set — now, you can voice chat with your Discord friends on your PS5, no matter what platform they're on.</p>
            <p>If you've previously linked your account for PlayStation Network to display what game you're playing, <strong>you'll have to link your account again to grant the permissions needed for Voice.</strong> If you were lucky enough to try out Discord Voice on PS5 during the beta phase, you won't need to link again.</p>

            <h2><strong>How to Use Discord Voice on PS5</strong></h2>
            <p>Now that your Discord and PlayStation accounts are all cozy and connected, it’s time to talk with your Discord friends on your PS5.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On mobile, slide up the Voice controls and you’ll see a new button that says “Join on PlayStation.” On desktop, the button looks sort of like a phone and a game controller next to each other.</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600pxpx">
                <div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/63dac556f0427e455da36d3f_OSgOyRxuPxBga0GUunZWCc6Q1wK4Ddr-OccU_1VgPDZRgDI3vzGZo2eXkXYNFTpMeL8xnhDv897r47Hlcmx8diV67-RWk7mFyEKj5iNv3g__zJ3jzWFRmpF512FxnafsTG8kG01QfToyu3TWfH0HzMQ.png" alt="Two side-by-side screenshots. The button to move your Voice conversation to PS5 is shown on both the desktop and mobile clients.&nbsp;"></div>
            </figure>
            <p>Next, you’ll be asked to choose which console that you want to transfer your Voice conversation to. Gamer Magic happens in the background and BOOM, your PS5 is where your conversation takes place at.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On console, you’ll be able to use all the familiar controls from Discord: mute or lower the volume of others while you get a snack, see the name of the voice channel you’re vibin’ in and hang up the call once you’re done — and it’s even faster to get talking with your DualSense™ controller’s built-in microphone.&nbsp;</p>
