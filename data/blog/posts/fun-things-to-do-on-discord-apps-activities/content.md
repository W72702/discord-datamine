            <h2><strong>How to Learn a Language Together on Discord<br></strong></h2>
            <p>Do you like to “@everyone” whenever possible? Yeah, I BET you do. Have you ever wanted to ping “@todos?” Share a message to “@tout le monde” or even “@みんな?” Well, none of those variations of the @everyone ping will actually work in Discord, but after learning a new language with Memrise, you’ll be able to talk to anyone and @everyone, no matter what language they speak!&nbsp;<br></p>

            </figure>
            <p>Using <strong>Memrise</strong>, you’ll be able to learn both a new language solo or with your server friends! Use the <strong>/learn solo</strong> command to start a private exchange to practice your language skills.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Once you’re ready to show what you’ve learned, or you’ve become an expert and want to talk with a friend who’s learning a language, the <strong>/learn together</strong> command will create a Thread so you and your fellow language learners can complete a challenge together.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There’s a lot to learn and enjoy with Memrise, so check the app out on the <a href="https://discord.com/application-directory">App Directory</a>.<em><br></em></p>

            <h2><strong>How to Motivate Yourself and Friends on Discord<br></strong></h2>
            <p>It’s a scientific fact that spending time with good friends brings good vibes. But sometimes, it’s worth an extra bump of encouragement when the vibes need a bit of uplifting.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That’s where <strong>Motivation</strong> comes in. By using Motivation’s aptly-named “<strong>/motivation”</strong> command, you’ll be able to share a bit of inspiration in the form of a motivational quote. That quote is then shared directly in the server for everyone to see, uplifting everyone’s mood and bringing just a bit more happiness to your friends, and depending on how big your server is, the world!&nbsp;</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1206pxpx">

            </figure>
            <p>You can also use the <strong>/sendquote</strong> command to send a motivational quote to a friend via Direct Message, or schedule motivational quotes using <strong>/reminder</strong>. It’s like a surprise present of positivity!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Your daily dose of affirmations and positive vibes starts with <a href="https://canary.discord.com/application-directory/1073302920562475219">Motivation</a>, over in the <a href="https://discord.com/application-directory">App Directory</a>. <br><br></p>

            <h2><strong>How to Share Stories With Your Friends on Discord</strong></h2>
            <p>Sharing how your day’s been is something that sounds easy on paper, but when there’s over 20 Discord channels in your server, each with their own ongoing conversations, you might think to yourself: where do I even begin? Will my friends also share their days? And how do I jumpstart the conversation?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>With a freshly-brewed <strong>Cappuccino</strong> of course!&nbsp;<br></p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:571pxpx">
                <div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64767317d303820190276281_73c51ae1.png" alt="The Cappuccino bot asking a question to the server: “What have you been up to today?” Three users have responded so far. "></div>
            </figure>
            <p>Cappuccino is an app that prompts everyone with a specific question to answer. Their answers are called “beans,” and once everyone answers the question, these beans are brewed together in one summary written just for your community, called a “cappuccino!”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Use the <strong>/cappuccino </strong>command to ask everyone a question of your own, or use the <strong>/coffee-break</strong> command to ask everyone what they've been up to. Don’t know what to ask? Brew up a <strong>/randomccino</strong> to ask the community a random question that’s collected and turned into a summary.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So whether you're a coffee connoisseur or just looking for a fun and engaging way to connect with others, Cappuccino has something for everyone; just grab a cup of your favorite brew and start up some coffee-fueled conversations!<br></p>
            <p>Open up your cafe and <a href="https://canary.discord.com/application-directory/1103981956267507712">add the app</a> to your server now.<br>‍</p>

            <h2><strong>How to Share Your Star Sign on Discord</strong></h2>
            <p>Sometimes, it’s not a story or a motivational quote that sparks thrilling conversation among your friends. It’s something that you’re born with: your ✨<em>astrological signs</em> ✨.&nbsp;</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600pxpx">

            </figure>
            <p>Channel your birth charts with CHANI: use it to know what the future holds by analyzing your birth chart, “Big Three” signs (your Sun, Moon, and rising signs), and how the current sky affects you and your friends that day. Use the <strong>/birth-chart</strong>,<strong> /current-sky </strong>and<strong> /big3 </strong>commands to learn everything you could ever want about your friends.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Comparing birth charts and big three placements in Discord is a great way to learn more about the people you talk to, game, or hangout with every day. Whether you believe in astrology or not, you’ll spark crazy conversation simply by going “...yeeaaah that makes sense for you.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Add the <a href="https://discord.com/application-directory">app</a> to your server <a href="https://discord.com/application-directory/1091677533558292521">here</a>, unless you’re a Capricorn, in which case you’ve likely already added the app to all of your friends’ servers by now…</p>

            <p>Checkers, word games, checkers, minigolf, checkers… did I mention checkers? I like checkers, especially when I can play it directly in Discord!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Activities are a selection of a ton of fun and — depending on who you play with — casual games and shared experiences that anyone can launch at any time. Next time you’re on a call in either a server or in DMs, <strong>use the rocketship button</strong> to choose between over a dozen Activities to play, directly within Discord.&nbsp;<br></p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600pxpx">

            </figure>
            <p>What exactly is available? You’ll find the full list of Activities over at <a href="https://discord.com/blog/server-activities-games-voice-watch-together">the dedicated Activities blog</a>. It’s always updated with the latest releases, so take a peek once in a while and see what’s new in the world of Activities on Discord.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Activities are supported on both desktop and mobile, so you’ll be able to start a game of Checkers with your friends on the go. And other games I guess, but ya’know… checkers is cool.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>How to Host YouTube Viewing Parties on Discord</strong></h2>
            <p>Remember those Activities we just mentioned? One of them is called “Watch Together,” a way to enjoy YouTube videos with your friends. To <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409342945687">Watch Together</a> with your friends on Discord, use that same rocketship button we mentioned previously, right next to your Video and Screenshare buttons.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Whoever starts the Watch Together activity becomes the Host and has the virtual remote, deciding what to watch. Everyone’s YouTube video is automatically synced together, so there’s no need to count to three loud in the call to make sure everyone’s on the same spot in the video.&nbsp;</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:580pxpx">

            </figure>
            <p>The Host can also share control with everyone&nbsp;in the Activity, allowing participants to freely queue up their picks on what should play next. First a 30-second cat clip, then a three hour video essay, followed by a 2 minute video about how to best brew a cup of coffee. What chaos ensues will likely be really telling about what you and your friends are like.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Like all Activities, Watch Together is available to anyone on Discord. Try it out in a Discord call next time you’re looking for something to watch!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>While we’ve shared a few ideas on what to do on Discord, we understand that you might be looking for something else. A way to post cats, throw a cake at your friends, or buff up your moderation abilities.

            </figure>
            <p>From image generation to community moderation, if there’s something you’ve ever wanted to do in Discord, you’ll likely find it in the App Directory. <strong>To explore what’s available, simply head into any server, then select the server’s name and open “App Directory.", or check it out </strong><a href="https://discord.com/application-directory"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
            <p>You’ll be able to explore the options within any server, but you can only add apps to servers that you have the right permissions for. If you don’t have the perms, consider asking a moderator in the server you’re in to add it!&nbsp;</p>
