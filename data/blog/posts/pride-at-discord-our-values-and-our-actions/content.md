            <p>Since the Stonewall uprising in New York City in June 1969, Pride has become a global movement to celebrate the dignity, power and joy of LGBTQIA+ people and communities around the world. In the face of repression, discrimination and violence, Pride represents standing up for the fundamental equality of all people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These values — equality, community, belonging — are the reason many people come to Discord. We strive to provide a platform to provide places to talk and where everyone can build genuine, meaningful relationships. LGBTQIA+ users and employees have been an essential part of Discord since our founding in 2015. We are proud that LGBTQIA+ people across the globe have used our service to talk, make friends, find support, establish meaningful relationships and build deep, lasting communities. We are particularly gratified when we hear that communities of Trans-identifying people have found Discord a safe space for important conversations and support.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>June is Pride Month, but Discord recognizes and celebrates Pride year-round, starting with our own workplace. We are committed to providing an environment where all employees belong. To support both our Pride ERG members and all Discord employees and their families, we’re proud to provide benefits including our Gender Affirmation Fund and a Medical Travel Fund to receive holistic care anywhere in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And while June is a time to celebrate Pride and acknowledge that the long arc of justice has moved forward since 1969, it is incredibly important to recognize we are in a moment where there are profoundly serious policy issues directed at the LGBTQIA+ community in the United States and around the world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hate has no place on Discord. Making clear Discord’s position, we are proud to be a signatory to the <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/business-statement-on-anti-lgbtq-state-legislation">Human Rights Campaign’s Business Statement</a>, which identifies and organizes leading businesses around the country to express opposition to policies targeting LGBTQIA+ people.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This year, Discord will donate to <a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/">The Transgender Law Center</a> and <a href="https://www.eqfl.org/">Equality Florida</a>, two groups helping secure equity for Trans-identifying people. And to continue to stand with our employees on issues of equality impacting the LGBTQIA+ and Trans communities, we will also match all employee donations to those organizations.<br>‍</p>
