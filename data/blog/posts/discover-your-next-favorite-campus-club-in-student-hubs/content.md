            <p>Students have been searching for and building communities on Discord for quite some time. The ways that students use Discord can be as diverse as student life itself — from hanging out with friends and studying together, to playing games and forming new clubs or societies, and even meeting new people with unique and shared interests.</p>
            <p>In many ways, Discord is a place that replicates the on-campus life online. You can join friends in Voice from the comfort of your couch when you’re done with studying, pull up a chair at a table with new acquaintances, or see a game your friends are playing and join in. Discord encourages and enables the same spontaneity and flexibility that defines much of campus life. It’s a role we take seriously and are honored to play.</p>
            <p>There’s so many ways that students are using Discord, but it can sometimes be hard to know what sorts of Discord servers exist within your campus community that you might want to be part of.</p>
            <p>We wanted to make it easier for you to find your classmates on Discord. So we created <strong>Student Hubs</strong>!<br><br></p>

            <h2>What are Student Hubs?</h2>
            <p><a href="http://discord.com/student-hubs">Student Hubs</a> are dedicated places for students on Discord that make it easy to meet classmates from your own school, discover their communities on Discord, and share your servers for your fellow classmates to join.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re going to campus every day or learning from home, there are always things going on that you might want to be part of but don’t know how to find. Looking to find classmates in your biology course? Or others that love playing Quadball? Or maybe you want to find a club or society you didn’t know existed but would love to join? Hubs are here to help make it easier to find your people on Discord.</p>

            <p>Since Hubs are a place for students to find and spend time with their classmates, each Hub is only accessible to users with an email address associated with that school. Student Hubs are not affiliated with schools, nor are the Communities listed within them.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>
            <h2>How to Join Your Classmates in a Student Hub</h2>
            <p>To access your school’s Student Hub, head into Server Discovery on the desktop or web app and select the new Student Hubs category. </p>
            <p>If you happen to be on desktop right now, click this handy dandy button to head there:</p>

            <p>Within your Hub, you can find your classmates in the member list, join a server, or add a server of your own! You can even search for a specific subject or club on Discord using the Search bar, just like Server Discovery.</p>
