            <p>Stick to what’s comfortable with three styles of DISXCORE shirts, including the <strong>grey faded short-sleeve tee</strong>, the <strong>long-sleeve light tee</strong>, and the <strong>women’s cut tee</strong> that’s dark grey with purple sleeves.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No matter which one you go for, you’ll be able to wear your stylish new <strong>DISXCORE button-down</strong> shirt over it. You can even wear the DISXCORE button-down over any other shirt, just in case your closet isn’t completely filled with solely Discord shirts. Or is that just me?</p>
            <p>We can’t forget to include a hoodie… that’s why the <strong>DISXCORE pullover hoodie</strong> is here to keep you <em>core</em>-mfortable during even the coldest of weather. Just look at how cozy this person below is in their Discord hoodie… this could be YOU:&nbsp;<br></p>

            <p>For any bag, shirt, or hoodie that you’ve already got and want to accessorize with <em>DISXCORE vibes</em>, get your hands on the <strong>Clyde pin</strong> and the <strong>Running Wumpus pin</strong>.</p>
