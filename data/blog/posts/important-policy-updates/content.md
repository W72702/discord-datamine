            <p><em>Update: On March 10th, 2023, the "How we approach privacy" section was updated to further clarify that Discord does not store or record voice or video content, and on March 13, 2023, further clarification about our updated </em><a href="https://discord.com/privacy"><em>Privacy Policy</em></a><em> was added.</em></p>
            <p><em>‍</em>‍</p>
            <p>Hi folks! It’s Important Announcement Day<sup>TM</sup> again: we’re updating our <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339366295">Paid Services Terms</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>! These changes go into effect on <strong>March 27, 2023</strong>.</p>
            <p>We regularly review our policies to ensure we're surfacing important information to our users in a clear and easy-to-understand way. As we continually work to improve our services and protect your privacy, we periodically update these policies to reflect those priorities and commitments to each other. </p>
            <p>Here are some highlights of what we’ve updated:</p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>How we describe our services: </strong>We added in a broader description of how Discord works, the features we offer, and how our services can be personalized for you. We want Discord to be <em>your </em>experience.</li>
                <li><strong>How we resolve disputes: </strong>We’ve updated our informal dispute resolution process and our arbitration agreement to lay out more detail on the steps you should take in case you have a dispute. We work hard to make sure you always love Discord and hope there’s never a dispute!</li>
                <li><strong>How we approach privacy:</strong> We provided more information about privacy rights and how they are exercised, and we have also updated what data we collect and how we use it. There has not been a change in Discord's position on how we store or record the contents of video or voice channels. We recognize that when we recently issued adjusted language in our Privacy Policy, we inadvertently caused confusion among our users. To be clear, nothing has changed and we have reinserted the language back into our <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, along with some additional clarifying information.<br><br>As a standard practice, Discord does not store or record the contents of video or voice channels. If we were to change our policy around this in the future, we would disclose that to you in advance. As always, your privacy is critically important to us, and we try to limit what information we collect and give you control over your privacy on Discord. </li>
                <li>‍<strong>How we explain our Community Guidelines: </strong>Our Community Guidelines are the foundation for how we work to keep you safe and give everyone the ability to find belonging on Discord. We’ve added more context and updated our explanations so our rules are easier to understand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can find a summary of the changes at the links below, but please do read the revised policies, as they are what actually govern your use of Discord:</p>
