            <p>Summer is the perfect time for gaming! For players of all genres, summer means catching up on the backlog you've been building up before the next set of releases happens in the fall. For those without a traditional summer break, gaming at any time helps you escape the daily monotony of your everyday routine, harkening back on those summer nights gaming with your best buds. Sometimes you just wanna relive the Halo 3 days, ya’know?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>No matter where you play, Discord is the ideal place to hang out and strategize on the game you’re playing. Or, don’t even talk about the game itself at all! Your gaming convos don’t <em>necessarily</em> have to be strictly about the game you’re playing. Talk about your strats in the next round of your competitive shooter or just grind dungeons solo as you talk about your week.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Today, we’re revealing some of the most-played games that YOU, the gamers of Discord, are playing day in and day out. </strong>Gather your friends, grab your preferred controller or keyboard and a mic to talk with, and jump into Discord’s most popular games while using Voice chat on your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PC, or mobile.</p>

            <h2><strong>What are the Most-Played Video Games on Discord?&nbsp; <br></strong></h2>
            <p>Like we said, this isn’t just a list that we threw together of games that we like (although we wouldn’t say no to playing a few of ‘em). The following games are the most played by users on Discord. Naturally, since people use Discord to communicate while playing, they all have some sort of multiplayer support.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We’ll tell you about each game and what platforms it’s available on. If you’re down to play any of them using a console, learn how to use Discord Voice using the following links:</p>

            <h2><strong><br>League of Legends</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
            <h6>Available on PC via official website or the Epic Games Store. Rated T.&nbsp;</h6>
            <p><a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends</a> has been around the block for over 14 years now, and it’s still one of the go-to MOBAs around (or, “Multiplayer Online Battle Arena” if you really wanna say the whole thing). Two teams of five players each, defending the giant crystal in the middle of their base. Your objective? Go in the enemy base and beat it up until it explodes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Simple enough on paper, but with over 140 characters to choose from each with multiple unique abilities, and a mind-boggling amount of variables, equipable items, and obstacles in the way, you’ll want to recruit all your friends on Discord to jump on Voice and tag along for the best chance at winning. Or, just spend hundreds of hours laughing at each other’s mistakes — it’s always a learning experience!&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong><br>Roblox</strong> </h2>
            <h6>Available on PC via official website, iOS, Android, and Xbox. Supports cross-play. Rated T.&nbsp;</h6>
            <p>What’s <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>? Honestly, what ISN’T Roblox?! It’s not <em>just</em> one particular game: it’s grown into its own platform where players can create anything they want, any genre, any mood or style, and share their experience with the world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Everything from life sims to shooters, to real-life recreations and games that require their own dedication. Some players play a variety of games, while others may spend hundreds of hours on just ONE game in Roblox. There’s a crazy amount of community-run Discord servers out there centered around specific Roblox experiences, so start off with the largest one below and go from there!&nbsp;</p>

            <h6>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC via Epic Games Store, and Android. Supports cross-play and cross-save. Rated T. &nbsp;&nbsp;</h6>
            <p>First announced as a base-building, tower-defending game, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=en-US">Fortnite</a> has become THE go-to Battle Royale game for years. It’s got character outfits for nearly everyone’s personality, an expansive amount of different IPs to create the ultimate squad, and plenty of ways to experience Fortnite without the need to be all shooty-shooty.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Play Fortnite’s popular Battle Royale mode, ease the stakes with some standard Team Deathmatch-style gametypes, or explore community-created game types (called “Islands”) that bring everything from obstacle courses and musical concerts to management simulators and haunted houses. You and your friends could spend days playing and screen-sharing every single Island that catches your eye!&nbsp;</p>

            <h6>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS, and Android. Supports cross-play. Rated E10+.</h6>
            <p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>’s got everything you could ever want: from built-in Survival and Creative modes available on every platform to a nearly never-ending amount of community-made visual upgrades, add-ons, and entirely new game modes made by its thriving modding scene. Plus, you can run the PC version on basically any computer that can run a spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Start a server where all your friends can spend all day exploring in a Voice call together, and check in for a few minutes on the mobile version of Minecraft. Or for the true tinkerers, plan out the perfect Minecraft mod setup in a Discord channel and the way you want the Java-based edition for PC — just keep in mind if you play the Java edition, you’ll only be able to play with others using the PC Java version.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>‍<strong><br>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong> </h2>
            <h6>Available on PC via Steam. Rated M.&nbsp;</h6>
            <p>Starting off as a community-made mod for Half-Life in 1999, Counter-Strike’s current iteration, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, is free to play for anyone to download and try on Steam. It’s been around for so long, you likely know a friend or server Discord server mutual who can show you the ropes if you’ve never played before. Or, I’m aging myself here… maybe your parents used to play Counter-Strike?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Plus, there’s finally a numbered sequel to Counter-Strike coming this year, aptly named Counter-Strike 2! But don’t let a new game on the horizon stop you from trying out Counter-Strike right now: any cosmetics you earn in CS:GO will transfer to CS2, so there’s no harm in picking up an AWP, jumping in and screensharing your sick 5 v 1 win on Discord.&nbsp;</p>

            <h6>Available on PC via Steam or the EA app, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Supports cross-play. Rated T.</h6>
            <p>Become the Champion of the Arena in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, a Battle Royale game where squads of up to three vie for supremacy against up to 60 other players at once. Unlike other Battle Royale games where everyone has the same “base” character, Apex Legends lets you pick from a selection of characters known as Legends, each with their own unique abilities.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Your group chat likely has that one person who DMs everyone to make sure they’re doing well who’d make a great medic, the ideal scout that’s always surveying the vibes before saying something, or the crazed one hopping between different Voice channels every five minutes. No matter the personality, you’ll all find the perfect Legend to fit your style and become Champions, together.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong><br>Valorant</strong>‍</h2>
            <h6>Available on PC via official website or the Epic Games Store. Rated T.&nbsp;</h6>
            <p>Take some of the core components of a competitive tactical shooter, the unique character roster of a hero shooter, mash ‘em together and you get <a href="https://playvalorant.com/">Valorant</a>: a 5v5 tactical shooter that incorporates characters, called Agents, with their own unique abilities that can turn the tides of battle.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Get the drop on the enemy team with your trusty rifle, or use one of the many Agent abilities to clutch that 1v5 battle and win for your squad. If you’re one for strategizing with your friends in a Discord call to outsmart the opposing team, Valorant may be the perfect game for ya. Plus, there’s a bunch of pretty (and pretty crazy) weapon skins to show off in Discord servers as you claim victory.</p>

            <h2><br>‍<strong>Grand Theft Auto V/Online</strong>‍</h2>
            <h6>Available on PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4. Supports cross-play. Rated M.</h6>
            <p>There’s a reason <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> is still played after nearly ten years: it’s an open-world game where you can freely explore a huge city, cause havoc in a multitude of ways, with both a lengthy, compelling single-player campaign and a multiplayer component that’s received constant updates for almost a decade.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Los Santos is your playground to leave destruction in your wake, do some actually-friendly taxi or ambulance work in single player, or become one of the most renowned crime lords in its multiplayer component, GTA Online. Hop into Discord and plan out some bank heists, matchmake in Team Deathmatch and Race modes, or just vibe and explore the city together. And this is all before even <em>considering</em> diving into the sprawling modding scene.</p>

            <h2><strong><br>Diablo IV </strong>‍</h2>
            <h6>Available on PC via Battle.net, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4. Supports cross-play and cross-save. Rated M.&nbsp;</h6>
            <p>As the newest release on this list, <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/">Diablo IV</a> is a dungeon-diving, XP-grinding, demon-hunting fest where you’ll create a character from one of five classes and save the area known as Sanctuary. Party up with up to four of your friends, or roam around solo and start an impromptu squad with other players roaming the land — be sure to tell ‘em how to call you on Discord though!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Once a quarterly season begins, everyone creates a new character for the season. This’ll let you try out new classes while starting on the same playing field as long-time Diablo enjoyers. Plus, ya’know, it’s Diablo: sometimes you just wanna mindlessly hunt some demons while talking with your friends about something completely unrelated! Just don’t scream <em>too</em> loudly in Voice when you get a sick Unique drop.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>‍<strong><br>Call of Duty</strong> </h2>
            <h6>The free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone is available on PC via Steam and Battle.net, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4. Supports cross-play and cross-save. Rated M.&nbsp;</h6>
            <p>Simply saying “<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/">Call of Duty</a>” encompasses a lot: there are people dipping their toes into free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone’s Battle Royale and DMZ modes, while others are grinding for hours in Modern Warfare 2 or still kickin’ around in Black Ops III Zombies.</p>
            <p>Call of Duty continues to be one of the most played games EVER, not just on Discord. And for good reason: it’s a solid foundation where gunplay feels finely crafted after years of releases, and each title released offers massive amounts of content. Nearly everyone has their favorite Call of Duty entry, and your planned game night on Discord might turn into a heated debate on which one was the best.&nbsp;</p>
