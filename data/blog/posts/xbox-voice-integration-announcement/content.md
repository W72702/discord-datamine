            <p>So: how does it work?<br>‍<strong><br></strong></p>
            <h2><strong>Connecting Your Xbox Account to Discord</strong></h2>
            <p>In order to start talking with your Discord friends on Xbox, you’ll need to connect your Xbox account to your Discord account. <strong>If you’ve connected your Xbox and Discord accounts before, you’ll need to connect them again </strong>to grant the new permissions needed to access Voice on your Xbox console.</p>
            <p>You’ll find the option to connect your accounts in User Settings &gt; Connections on desktop, web, or mobile. Select the Xbox logo within the Connections menu and follow the prompts to get all set up!&nbsp;</p>
