            <p><em>We always strive to improve your experience on Discord. Check out these hacks to get more out of your settings.</em></p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>‍<strong>Custom video upload quality.</strong> You can now choose the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/9665451164951-Video-Upload-Quality-Settings-on-Mobile-FAQ">default quality</a> of your video uploads and Discord will automatically compress them.<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Low data? No problem. </strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/9665451164951-Video-Upload-Quality-Settings-on-Mobile-FAQ">Data Saving Mode</a> now works for both videos and images. Use this setting to send media files in lower quality and reduce data usage on your cellular plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What your system theme says, goes.</strong> Discord can now detect your mobile device settings for light and dark themes. To automatically change themes based on your system settings, go to App Settings &gt; Appearance and change your theme to Automatic.<strong>‍</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Edit your profile (or profiles) on mobile. </strong>Feeling a special vibe today? Change your user and server profiles from the same location! Nitro subscribers can edit their Profile Theme, too. When the mood strikes, head to User Settings &gt; Profiles to check it out.&nbsp;</li>
