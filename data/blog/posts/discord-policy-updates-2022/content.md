            <p><br>We built Discord to be a place that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong, but not at the expense of others. Keeping Discord safe and welcoming is what allows people to find a place to belong and that’s why safety is one of our most important investments and priorities. </p>
            <p>As a Discord user, you’re probably familiar with our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>: they explain what kind of behavior isn’t allowed or tolerated on Discord. These guidelines operate alongside policies that are intended to prevent or mitigate harm to our users. </p>
            <p>When we become aware of a violation of our Community Guidelines and policies, our team takes action, which can include anything from warning or banning accounts, to removing servers, and engaging with the authorities as appropriate. We encourage users to report any activity that violates our guidelines, Terms of Service, or our other policies in the Discord mobile app. Learn more about submitting a report <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>As part of our ongoing efforts to keep users safe, we regularly review and update our policies and Community Guidelines. During this process, our Policy team assesses the potential harms caused by a particular type of content or behavior. We look at the problem holistically and try to understand how it manifests not just on Discord, but also on the internet and society more broadly.</p>
            <p>In the first half of this year, our team focused on updating policies to address the biggest issues that we saw users experiencing on Discord. For today’s post, we want to share our approach to this kind of content and behavior.</p>
