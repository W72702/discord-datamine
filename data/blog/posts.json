When we introduced streaming to players on PC and mobile, we wanted to help recreate the feeling of your friends lounging on the same couch, playing their favorite games and joking with each other, in a virtual environment from anywhere in the world. As cross-play between platforms continues to grow, so does our journey of bringing players together, wherever they play.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Streaming your game on Discord is a great way to socialize with your buddies. Some use it to show off a new party game to their friends, while others stream single-player games to share their character builds and spread the word on hidden areas. The more hardcore players even use streaming to show off their competitive skills and clutch plays in multiplayer matches!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>At the end of the day, streaming a game you love on Discord is a way to connect and bond with your friends, no matter what you happen to be playing. But this experience has been exclusive to PC and mobile users... <br><br>…until now.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Today, we’re <em>stoked</em> to announce one of the most requested Discord features: the ability to <strong>stream games from your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One console directly to Discord</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c949cbcdc69ba8187888a1_wA3eAcEvlfK-nB3SUR00Hdm26uNLsBF8XIq5XWwlfQ1Ai1oDnp9L0Z2DbtZI89SubmC8cPvT6VUPceeDc-SxjEZ6D3D5eFGGHXOqVwN49fe88cC3nwaWsvydFod8itPw1GE0NWdYOdTA3PjEFzydNmA.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of an Xbox in the middle of a Discord Voice call.

The best part? <em>We are far from finished</em>, and we’ll have more news to share alongside our friends at Xbox later this year.</p>\n            <p>For more info on how Stream to Discord works, take a peek at the next section!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <p>Streaming your game from Xbox to Discord is just as easy as talking with your friends using Discord Voice on Xbox!</p>\n            <p>If you’ve never connected your Xbox account to Discord, keep reading. If you’ve already connected your Xbox account to use Discord Voice chat on your console, skip down to either the “Stream to a Discord Server” or “Stream to a DM” sections.</p>\n            <h3><strong>First, Connect Your Xbox Profile to Discord (If You Haven’t Already)</strong></h3>\n            <p>This is what makes the magic happen. First, head into <strong>User Settings &gt; Connections </strong>on Discord for desktop or mobile. Within the Connections menu, you’ll see an Xbox logo. Click that, sign into your Microsoft account, and you’ll be all set up!&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1494pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c949ef1435063628483aba_TmkRi3asrZEidaKNlMnXjxPd3eESP5emHwcfOvCVhrNWpOhpnVZeZm7Ji3htE9OY1rqTh4Zll0F0T2JCqnrMSYAJLesWej1bLmciZIUrM-TexI0ixKL7ApG_iEWVc8S-eYTDH_1kMQ2j9_rF3JPWEZ0.png\" alt=\"The User Settings menu of the Discord desktop app. The “Connections” tab is opened, and option to connect an Xbox account to your Discord profile is highlighted by a dotted circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>If you’ve <strong>already connected your accounts in the past to use Discord Voice on Xbox</strong>, there’s no need to re-connect your accounts.</p>\n            <p><em>✨ Congratulations✨ </em>: you’ve completed the most complex part of this entire process. Now for the easy bit: streaming to Discord!</p>\n            <h3><strong>Then, Stream from Your Xbox to a Discord Server</strong></h3>\n            <p>Once you’re all connected, the next time you press the Xbox button on your controller and open the Parties &amp; Chats tab on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One, select Discord, then scroll to one of your available servers and join a Voice channel. You’ll be placed in that community’s Voice channel. Select “Stream your game” when you’re ready to start streaming.</p>\n            <p>Final step: <em>enjoy</em>!</p>\n            <p>Nitro members can even utilize the sweet streaming perks provided by their subscription and Stream to Discord in HD quality, up to 1080p and increased framerates! Perfect for keeping up with speedy racers, showing off gorgeous game worlds, or getting a high-quality view of the puzzle you’re asking your friends for help with.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Or, Stream from your Xbox to a Discord DM or Group DM</strong></h3>\n            <p>Want to stream your gameplay to a DM call or a Group DM? Join your DM call on desktop or mobile, then use the “Transfer to Xbox” button to move your DM conversation to your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One. Once moved over, the “Stream your game” option will appear in the Xbox guide, just like if you were in a server call.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Not in the mood to stream your game the second you join Voice? No worries — select a server and voice channel where you want to hang with your friends and start talkin’ away. Once you’re ready to stream your game, just hit the Xbox button again and select “Stream your game.”</p>\n            <p>For the finer details on how streaming or transferring works, be sure to check out either <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003953831-Discord-and-Xbox-Connection-FAQ\">Discord’s Help Center article on Connecting Your Accounts</a> if you’ve never connected an account before, or <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/friends-social-activity/parties-chat/using-discord-with-xbox\">Xbox’s Support article on Streaming to Discord</a> if you’re all connected and ready to stream your gameplay. <br></p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af39ab3444cc7752b350bc_Yv1sVQ0PEYcPltp2fsAFFQGssZWaiOsM4weJl2lavF-vySTX0PcEhWMhmIOH-aZyp3MwRjPAq7tzCBNXzFXbQgUGv5-8ZpAy5pHqc5Dn7_CAkgpB13KP-CZar9DFAFeIHgRdDtYpJJ3mT2TqF2t8IKU.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>The teams at both Xbox and Discord are <em>incredibly</em> excited about native game streaming to Discord, and we hope you are, too — and we’re just as hyped for what the future holds between Xbox and Discord.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Xbox streaming to Discord happened because of you, the users and Xbox players, who let us know what you want to see come to Discord.

And when we say “talk,” we mean it literally: at any given moment, millions of people across the globe are talking in voice or video calls on Discord.</p>\n            <p>We know that keeping your calls private is a big part of feeling secure online. At Discord, <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-privacy\">user privacy</a> has always been one of our highest values and priorities.</p>\n            <p>At the same time, we rely on servers all over the world to deliver robust, low-latency voice and video calls. In fact, we regularly add additional server locations. As we continue to expand internationally, we do our best to protect your calls from prying eyes and ears, no matter where&nbsp;servers are located.</p>\n            <p>That’s why we are beginning to experiment with new encryption protocols and technologies for voice and video calls on Discord. These protocols would support best-in-class performance and large calls without quality degradation or additional latency.</p>\n            <p>End-to-end encryption is designed to allow only the participants in a call to decipher its contents. One of the protocols we’re experimenting with is called Messaging Layer Security, which we believe would allow us to deliver end-to-end encryption at scale. Intermediaries, including platforms like Discord, are unable to access the content of communications encrypted with end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’re starting to experiment and don’t yet know how or if these technologies will be deployed for our users, but we’ll be consulting with experts in the field along the way. <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/privacy-and-safety-on-discord\">As we recently explained</a>, we don’t take a one-size-fits-all approach to different spaces and experiences on Discord. Our current encryption experiments do not apply to Stages, which are designed for a different type of communication and rely on different technical systems than those used for other calls.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Privacy and safety are each core values at Discord. As we work to protect our users’ privacy, we’ll continue to invest heavily in safety features, technologies and systems.</p>\n            <p>As we experiment with encryption technologies over the coming months, we’ll be listening to feedback and iterating rapidly.

Either method adds friction for users by necessitating a second device for logins while increasing the cost to attackers. However, both have problems. SMS MFA is widely regarded as insecure because of the proliferation of SIM jacking attacks that allows for intercepting SMS-delivered MFA codes— but TOTP MFA is also phishable.</p>\n            <p>MFA push notifications are also trivially easy to overcome. People’s attention can easily be exhausted. Look no further than Uber’s recent security incident in <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/uber-breach-hacker-twilio-mfa\">mid-September last yea</a><a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/uber-breach-hacker-twilio-mfa\">r</a>; that was the likely entrypoint Lapsus$ exploited in order to gain access to Uber’s internal systems.</p>\n            <p>Moreover, TOTP and push MFA are difficult to use frequently. They don’t vet that you’re logging in on a known device in a known location. They require use of a third-party authenticator app. Users lose their phones, and it’s difficult to have codes available on multiple devices. Some authenticator apps do support backing up TOTP secrets to a cloud account although backups are not typically enabled by default, which leaves users hanging out to dry if they lose access to their authenticator app.</p>\n            <p>Back when I joined Discord, a staff engineer on my team had been pushing for us to adopt “WebAuthn”, and soon. I’d heard of it of course, but they pointed us to a thread from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frgx/status/1379504541666701313?lang=en\">Dev at Figma</a> chronicling their adoption of WebAuthn. WebAuthn and other hardware-based MFA mechanisms significantly reduce the incidence of account takeovers (ATOs) at companies like Google and Coinbase:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c41fecda9a7827b366cc5f_image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Authentication Type chart displaying Percentage of ATOs associated using the noted authentication mechanism as of November 2022.

We’d been using MFA with Google Workspace for years; we swapped people over to using MFA with Okta just a few months prior to the kickoff of this project in April 2022. So, we were pushing for behavior change after behavior change.</p>\n            <p>We wanted to change user behavior and incur additional hardware/support spend by rolling out WebAuthn. The idea of tying authentication to a user’s device worried people as well; would this lead to more lockouts? Would it lead to more support costs incurred to our hard-working IT team?</p>\n            <p>We wanted to show that WebAuthn was <strong>safer, easier, and more cost-effective</strong> when compared to the status quo of TOTP MFA.</p>\n            <h3>WebAuthn: <strong><em>Safer</em></strong></h3>\n            <p>Thanks to a lot of great research from Google and other companies that they’ve published, it’s quite easy (and compelling!) to compare successful account takeover (ATO) or account compromise (ACO) attempts by different authentication factors:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c824608ce80e02353aa56e_Untitled.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart source: https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html\"></div>\n                <figcaption><em>source: </em><a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html\"><em>security.googleblog.com</em></a></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Even more compelling, I got to include this very-definitive statement from the same research in my document:</p>\n            <blockquote>“We have had no reported or confirmed account takeovers since implementing security keys at Google.”</blockquote>\n            <p>It’s rare you get to be that definitive in security!</p>\n            <h3>WebAuthn: <strong><em>Easier</em></strong></h3>\n            <p>I don’t know about you, but while I appreciate the security advantages of TOTP MFA, it does not spark joy to fish my phone out of my pocket, unlock it, and unlock my authenticator app, and feel the Damoclesian “T” in Time-based One Time Password counting down just to log into a service.</p>\n            <p>TOTP MFA is fairly secure as it is difficult to brute force; but by comparison, the typical experience for a user with WebAuthn set up using a platform authenticator here is:</p>\n            <ol role=\"list\">\n                <li>App (like Okta) challenges for WebAuthn factor</li>\n                <li>User taps WebAuthn-compatible peripheral like Macbook TouchID sensors</li>\n                <li>…that’s it!</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p>Even a cellphone holster can’t compete on friction like that.</p>\n            <h3>WebAuthn: <strong><em>More Cost-Effective; Easier to Support</em></strong></h3>\n            <p>Committing to spend money to buy hardware not only for <em>everyone today</em> but <em>everyone forever</em> is a big ask. We were looking at a cost of about $100/user that would scale linearly with headcount. We also had the specter looming over us of more IT-serviced lockout requests.</p>\n            <p>But the comparison isn’t to one of <em>doing nothing</em>. Inaction leaves us perpetually exposed, at a much higher likelihood, to a successful phishing attack targeting somebody who works for us. It’s a very common vector nowadays for breaches of companies.</p>\n            <p>According to IBM, the cost of a <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach\">US-based company experiencing a data breach averages $9.44M in 2022</a>. You could buy a heck of a lot of WebAuthn-compatible peripherals for that much money. At $30/pop, that’s <strong>over eight times the length of the Golden Gate Bridge in Yubikeys</strong> stacked end to end!</p>\n            <p>Moreover, relying upon additional great research from Google, we were able to show that moving to hardware-based MFA methods would actually <em>decrease support burden</em> over time by <strong>fewer lockouts</strong>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c82513656905713b57fd63_image%20(2).png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Source: https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/45409.pdf\"></div>\n                <figcaption>source: <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/45409.pdf\">Lang, Juan, et al. <em>Security Keys: Practical Cryptographic Second Factors for the Modern Web</em></a></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Google’s research (linked above) summed up the improvements in support burden below:</p>\n            <blockquote>For the deployment, we found the increased user productivity, and decreased support cost, were worth the increased hardware cost.</blockquote>\n            <p>This meant that we would not only relieve some pressure with IT with this change, but also prevent more MFA lockouts that were already hurting our corporate users!

Some users are on portable laptops; some are permanently docked. Some are even on desktops!</p>\n            <p>Our goal was to ensure everyone had at least two functional authenticators at any time.</p>\n            <p>We had a few tools in mind, with a few escape hatches.</p>\n            <p><strong>Platform authenticators</strong>: these are WebAuthn authenticators embedded in the device we’re attempting to sign in with. The vast majority of our users were on Macbooks with TouchID or laptops with Windows Hello, meaning we could rely upon users <strong><em>usually</em></strong> having one of these two factors to register.</p>\n            <p><strong>Roaming authenticators:</strong> these are WebAuthn peripherals not embedded in the device. For us, we used Yubikeys as our roaming authenticators.</p>\n            <p>Specifically, we chose to give most people the <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/us/product/security-key-c-nfc-by-yubico/\">Yubikey Security Key C NFC</a> as their roaming authenticator. We chose this for a few reasons:</p>\n            <ol role=\"list\">\n                <li>It supports NFC, not just USB-C, meaning you can use it to bootstrap a new iPhone or Android phone to service as a mobile platform authenticator</li>\n                <li>It’s big and bulky, so people are less likely to leave them in their laptops, meaning users are less likely to combine their “roaming” and “platform” authenticator into one laptop-shaped bundle</li>\n                <li>It doesn’t support OTP mode, so there’s no “Yubispam” to deal with</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p>In some cases, like docked users or devices without platform authenticators, we provided keys like the USB 5c Nano to use in place of the Platform Authenticator instead while also supplying Security Key C NFCs as backups.</p>\n            <p>Our docs reflected our typical choices, but we always worked with users to find something appropriate and usable to make them successful.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>How’d ‘The Plan’ Go?</h2>\n            <p>So, here’s our planned timeline:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c8257dd12acbbdd9c0b5ed_image%20(3).png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Project Kickoff May 2022; Security, IT, Infra, Execs June 2022; All FTEs July 2022; Everyone August 2022\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>And here’s how it actually went:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64c82593bb950f4237b71282_image%20(4).png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Project Kickoff May 2022; Security, IT, Infra, Execs June 2022, All FTEs July 2022, Everyone 2023\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>So, what happened? We have a few learnings to share:</p>\n            <ol role=\"list\">\n                <li>Fulfillment to a distributed global team is <strong>really hard.</strong> Work from home makes this even more complicated! My advice: pay for importers in any difficult-to-ship-to countries</li>\n                <li>Always test on yourself first before shipping keys out to users. Because we did this for weeks, we were able to aggressively roll out to all FTEs on our original timeline!</li>\n                <li>Listen to concerns, and find a path forward for unusual cases. We were changing people’s behavior. If they are docked 100% of the time and requested a WebAuthn-compatible keyboard we let them buy their favorite and expense it.</li>\n                <li>Lean on enterprise shipping partners where you can. We used Yubico Enterprise Delivery, and their portal helped with US, UK, EU, etc. adoption tremendously. But: they don’t support every country we needed, so we had some complications to work through ourselves</li>\n                <li>For enforcement: stick to your dates, but allow for exceptions. The “Exception Group” in the plan let us move the needle forward without blocking on the longest tail cases— invaluable!</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>What’s it like now?</h2>\n            <p>Nowadays, newly-onboarded Discord corporate users receive a laptop and at least one Yubikey alongside that laptop. IT onboards users to Okta and instructs them to register at least two WebAuthn authenticators; typically, this is their Macbook’s TouchID/Windows Hello sensor and also their Security Key C NFC.</p>\n            <p>We also instruct corporate users to set up Okta Verify for use only as a fallback MFA in the event that all their authenticators fail at once. This way, we never have user accounts lacking at least one strong form of multi-factor authentication.</p>\n            <p>Lockouts at the worst require overnighting a Yubikey to the user; all the while they’re still protected by hardware MFA. We set up an “exception” group that we track with expiring membership to ensure users cannot stay without WebAuthn protecting their Okta sessions for quite a while.</p>\n            <p>The rollout took some effort, but the change has been very impactful, and users love the ease of use when compared with TOTP or other forms of MFA!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>A Call to Action</h2>\n            <p>Phishing attacks are prevalent, and the threat is urgent to address.

For players of all genres, summer means catching up on the backlog you've been building up before the next set of releases happens in the fall. For those without a traditional summer break, gaming at any time helps you escape the daily monotony of your everyday routine, harkening back on those summer nights gaming with your best buds. Sometimes you just wanna relive the Halo 3 days, ya’know?&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>No matter where you play, Discord is the ideal place to hang out and strategize on the game you’re playing. Or, don’t even talk about the game itself at all! Your gaming convos don’t <em>necessarily</em> have to be strictly about the game you’re playing. Talk about your strats in the next round of your competitive shooter or just grind dungeons solo as you talk about your week.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Today, we’re revealing some of the most-played games that YOU, the gamers of Discord, are playing day in and day out. </strong>Gather your friends, grab your preferred controller or keyboard and a mic to talk with, and jump into Discord’s most popular games while using Voice chat on your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PC, or mobile.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>What are the Most-Played Video Games on Discord?&nbsp; <br></strong></h2>\n            <p>Like we said, this isn’t just a list that we threw together of games that we like (although we wouldn’t say no to playing a few of ‘em). The following games are the most played by users on Discord. Naturally, since people use Discord to communicate while playing, they all have some sort of multiplayer support.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’ll tell you about each game and what platforms it’s available on.

We believe in its value in aiding hanging out and having fun with friends. On Discord, rather than just going solo with an app, you can supercharge your conversations and share the experience of seeing what sorts of exciting, wild and sometimes silly results come from prompts.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>When friends are on Discord together to hang out, play games, or study, they often use apps to give their servers a more personal touch. Just like a treehouse, after you build your server and invite your friends, you decorate it and make it your own, based on hobbies, interests, and topics you care about.</p>\n            <p>AI-powered apps have made their homes in nearly three million Discord servers, ranging from AI companions, to groups generating gaming assets with AI and AI-based learning communities. More than 30 million people already use AI apps on Discord every month!&nbsp; Whether you’re generating a shiny new avatar or putting into words something you can’t quite figure out on your own, there’s a lot to explore and we love seeing how people are using our platform to discover what’s possible together.</p>\n            <p>Let's dive into some popular AI apps on Discord:<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Kickstart the Conversation in Any Language</strong>‍</h2>\n            <p>On Discord, you can use AI to shake up your conversation with friends – catch up on the latest or learn a language together.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3>Cappuccino</h3>\n            <p>No one likes the age-old, open-ended question of: “How has your day been?” Where do you even begin? Will your friends also share how their days have been? And how do you even jumpstart the conversation?&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Why, with a freshly-brewed Cappuccino of course! Cappuccino is an app that prompts everyone with one specific question to answer. Their answers are called “beans,” and once everyone answers the question, these beans are brewed together using the latest language models into a written summary just for your community, called a “Cappuccino!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1126px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af38ddd67a6670dcb734d8_3Qa9fBBRxeQCP6InxVuEUnm1zoIzKMrolh5KusZETRDptKFObcsw9gX9Yw2bujyyDsHVP3sPPCorz4Uo-w7YGyJaMZMM-mf9hUz-Dc61WpBoNXj4l0wKvkrLk796YATTZH5w8445kL66WtfPzx6Ui8M.png\" alt=\"A demonstration of the Cappuccino app for Discord.

Their mobile app is one of the most popular language learning tools in the world, with more than 65 million users. Memrise takes a non-traditional approach to language learning: rather than focusing on teaching you the grammar and syntax of a language, Memrise focuses on teaching you to have conversations in a new language.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1244px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af38ddd67a6670dcb734e7_IUFA73QwkKY09GCT9Y5BcrFEAi1EifQpzPuocfxgLMrzwnzXR-TxkoGeIoU2_qPs5uMqdTkuNzgCxtlZhJ09dWzPaQZe9K-ih7zpKPTXKVTJqmKz_M8VSahh1ELRob9CJR0R8HqO1Wayz7vrorDgShU.png\" alt=\" preview of the Memrise app for Discord.

You might find yourself persuading a car salesman to give you a great deal or convincing a barista to treat you to a free coffee.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>The app gives you tips and hints if you are stuck, helping you to learn the best replies, and corrects you if you make mistakes.

With the power to transform written descriptions into vibrant visual representations, users can unlock limitless creative possibilities. As one of Discord’s largest communities, already embraced by over 16 million users worldwide, Midjourney empowers individuals to bring their ideas to life, whether it's designing avatars or creating wholly unique images for their creative aspirations.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1154pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af39abe2fae9ed43c0d370_PFeeG0Sp-tOzjID-B4nZZqiQuMwxg_Rf5C8UMze7jDftxLpZe99S0PoaBtcXt-tswQG-losf0aT7IMyRZh45MUsgaGBV2tWqbqldr9ZkOiJBGTxlQGtKBGLctwsyeP3g0Zm1AhS0_E6Etq5neRt09yo.png\" alt=\"A preview of the Midjourney app for Discord.

From there, users can select one of those variations and Midjourney will create four more - and so on. Once you have your favorite unique, refined image, you can upscale it and save it to use or even blend it with other images you have. You can hop into the official Midjourney server to use the app there, or add the app to your own Discord server to use among your friends!</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed\">\n                <div class=\"btn-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/application-directory/936929561302675456\" class=\"btn-blog w-button\" target=\"_blank\">Add Midjourney to Your Server</a></div>\n            </div>\n            <h3><strong><br>AI Image Generator&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n            <p>This one’s a bit self-explanatory, but here’s the scoop on its backstory. The AI Image Generator app for Discord was developed in late 2022 with one purpose: to generate custom images based on user prompts. At that time, there was a huuuge surge of news about new AI technology, but most of the services you may have seen talked about back then were beyond the reach of individuals without expensive hardware.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:740pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af39ab46dca2e24f1eaebb_ZuV8GUf3v6Kd4wQqcW_AuJTLTi-ep8jUdMfS7KxHM0Al3pLrGA3fSADf0yff9lKpT_IrEsQ31EPwcp1ubMoXs5B0MfA1gREXpakIxtIpmQByFRLj2W-S0FD_7v7P0P_pspxDiDSHhESDfxK0YX3IUEc.png\" alt=\"A preview of the AI Image Generator app. A user has requested the app to upscale a small image of a dog, and AI Image Generator has provided a very fluffy puppy as a result. They look very soft.&nbsp;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>The creators of the AI Image Generator app wanted to provide an opportunity for everyone to have fun and experiment with AI by offering unlimited image generation for free. The app offers a wide range of settings, including custom resolutions, the ability to fine-tune the number of iterations an image goes through, and even the option to request multiple images at a time. AI Image Generator also has the capability to upscale an image you really like the result of to higher resolutions.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>AI Image Generator leverages slash commands and big ol’ buttons to help you and your friends interact with the app more seamlessly and enjoy a smoother overall experience.&nbsp;</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed\">\n                <div class=\"btn-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/application-directory/1032699319368814652\" class=\"btn-blog w-button\" target=\"_blank\">Add AI Image Generator to Your Server</a></div>\n            </div>\n            <h3><strong><br>AI Bot&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n            <p>Yep, it’s just called AI Bot. Why just AI Bot? Because there’s nothing bot-ter. <br><br>AI Bot offers a wide variety of entertaining features, with one of its key functionalities being image generation powers using technologies such as Dall-E Mini, Stable Diffusion, and Anime Diffusion (you heard that right, Anime Diffusion). Server members can generate unique and entertaining images by simply using the “/image” command and describing what they want to come to life.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:539pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af39ab29866b3f86f15911_nMKY537Jha8VSwwXLyQ5HnZCBBykILSMWUjG-yBrRbfjGTzVQjkas9w374UnrblbJhXE0W7WW6nBnI0_AuYGodJ3bL7jG7WGMMjwjbPnKO_LYWun19STvzZzlB9jW-Pot9UiNpLiH62exlzrornyIbs.png\" alt=\"A preview of AI Bot. A user has promoted an image of “a space vehicle in the shape of an alien spaceship flying in the air and looking at the planet,” and the bot has generated their request.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>AI Bot also features a chatbot that can be set up in specific channels or summoned using a slash command. The app’s chatbot uses natural language processing algorithms to engage in conversations with users, providing an entertaining, dynamic, and natural experience. A story option is also in the works, which will let users generate fascinating and creative stories with the help of AI again. Perhaps your newly-generated samurai shoebill needs a backstory?

That’s why we’ve made safety a top priority.</p>\n            <p>In addition to building safety features that <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044153831-helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-discord\">both parents and teens can use to customize their Discord experience</a>, we regularly <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">update our community guidelines</a> to further efforts to protect our users, especially teens, and recently launched a new <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety\">Safety Center</a> containing more information and resources on building a safer Discord experience.</p>\n            <p>Everyone’s online safety needs and expectations are different, which is why we broadly invest in diverse sets of tools and resources to support our users. That’s why as a next step we’re excited to introduce the <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-family-center\"><strong>Family Center</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n            <p>Discord's <strong>Family Center</strong> is a new opt-in tool that makes it easy for teens to keep their parents and guardians informed about their Discord activity while respecting their autonomy. Similar to how parents know who their teens are friends with and what clubs they’re a part of at school, Family Center helps them learn more about who their teens are friends with and talk to on Discord. Our goal with Family Center is to help foster productive dialogue about safer internet habits, and to create mutually beneficial ways for parents and teens to connect about experiences online.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-family-center\" class=\"btn-blog w-button\">Family Center</a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <p>Read on to learn more about Family Center, how parents, guardians and teens can set up the new tool and learn what’s shared (and what isn’t).</p>\n            <h2><strong>For Parents and Guardians: Setting Up Family Center<br></strong></h2>\n            <p>Discord’s Family Center has two major components: a new activity dashboard accessible from Discord at any time, and a weekly email summary containing high level information about your teen’s activity. You’ll find the Family Center in <strong>User Settings &gt; Family Center</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>To get started, we require both you and your teen to complete setup through the official Discord app. Each step in the setup process is designed to protect your teen’s account. Teen account activity is not shared in Family Center without their consent.</p>\n            <p>After you and your teen have discussed using this feature together, you’ll need to ask them for a QR code easily generated in Family Center. It’s important to know that these QR codes are unique and only active for a short amount of time. So if another parent is ready to connect their account with your teen they’ll have to repeat these steps. Once you complete setup, we’ll notify you every time a new parent is connected to your teen in Family Center.</p>\n            <p><strong>Teen accounts connected to yours via Family Center will share the following information with you in a dashboard that is accessible in-app at any time:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1322pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64a5c74c2cce684638433145_Znv45dvfxIp6-NfPzNcTPlu40vhHKL-8gnS_76mgzT9akh7F3TzbXrhXQiZJolGBhJkO_IW0KRqgGSxjvjkKXri1i8a8CvGRei5xv7eQ2aez2YRxGIV0WaBia4oqUReGQtQ_fffjV3r53vnfrqV4S1A.png\" alt=\"An in-app preview of the information that Family Center provides. The image explains the following: Parents can see the Names and Avatars of Recently-added Friends, the names, icons and member counts of Servers they’ve joined or participated in, and the names, avatars, and times of last message or call of Users a Teen has messaged or called in DMs and Group Chats. Parents cannot see “what their teen writes or says.”&nbsp;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Once your teen has accepted your connection request, the Family Center will populate with details about their activity on Discord within the last seven days. This includes the <strong>number of users they’ve messaged or called, the number of new friends they’ve added, and how many servers they’re actively participating in</strong>. Family Center won’t contain a complete archive of activity and will only highlight activity occurring after your teen has accepted your connection request.</p>\n            <p><strong>In addition to the in-app Family Center, you’ll also receive a weekly recap of this information via email.</strong> Keep an eye out in the email address associated with your Discord account for the latest activity updates.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:950pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64a5cd3a82f9e3fec201f0e5_Email%20Summary%20Cropped.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A preview of the weekly recap email from the Family Center.

As such, it’s important to remember that<strong> with the Family Center, you’ll know which users your teen is talking to and what Discord communities they’re participating in, but you won’t be able to see the contents of the conversations themselves.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>If you have questions or concerns about the people or servers your teen is engaging with, we encourage you to have a conversation with them directly about maintaining healthy online habits or ask them about their newest friends or communities.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>For additional guidance on setting up the Family Center, take a look at the Family Center <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14155043715735\">support article</a>.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Supporting Healthy Online Habits with Family Center</strong></h2>\n            <p>This new tool is just the beginning of our family-first initiatives. We encourage parents and guardians to use the information provided by the <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-family-center\">Family Center</a> to open up conversations about online safety with your teen.</p>\n            <p>For parents who are searching for more resources from trusted organizations, we also highlight partner resources to Discord from ConnectSafely and National PTA in our new <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-parents\">Parents Hub</a>. Our expert partners have been crucial to informing our prioritization of building this tool and overall approach to keep our younger users safe. Additionally, we published <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/commitment-to-teen-child-safety\">an article</a> highlighting our commitments to teen and child safety including a look at our safety and product philosophy and an in depth look at our teen and child safety policies.</p>\n            <p>And of course, we’re always listening — if you have any ideas for features to help families stay connected and safe on the platform, you can reach out to us <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">here</a>.</p>\n            <h4><strong>Hear From Our Partners</strong></h4>\n            <p>\"Family Center provides parents with what they need to help guide their teen's use of Discord without being too invasive. It's like the physical world where you know who your kids are hanging out with and where they're going but not listening in on their conversations or micromanaging their relationships.&nbsp; Tools like Family Center can help parents help their teens develop the habits and critical thinking skills that apply not only to Discord but all of life.\" - Larry Magid CEO ConnectSafely.org</p>\n            <p>“It is essential that families are empowered with knowledge, tools and resources so they can support healthy digital habits for their children. When platforms offer resources like Discord’s new Family Center, this information helps facilitate meaningful conversations between teens and their parents and caregivers about how to be safe, responsible and respectful online. National PTA will continue to work with our partners including Discord to create a healthier digital environment for teens and families.” - National PTA President Yvonne Johnson</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

It shouldn’t matter if you’re able-bodied or adapt your game to fit your needs, as long as you’re having fun playing.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>The Kuni Corner community is a prime example of not letting any sort of obstacles get in the way of what you enjoy. Led by Vinesauce team member Imakuni, it’s grown from a simple sub-only server into a space that Imakuni says is “extremely friendly &amp; open to newcomers.”</p>\n            <p>‍</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:861pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64a6f907d35a52e4bf4d147d_N1wKQUp3mMNa-AxK8zxuIVAUbUYW5Piq0tWrJ_Ztj8Tx5BstDBr7iJYB2EqFW6d4ImE2pzTu7ufuUxaY5UW8HM1ei9Ow-ovyTdZ3lJAeCv5EdR_lyDjdgqs5BLGEI-QBL_J8Tgor7vsOPCtZCKZiX3k.png\" alt=\"Server invite artwork for the featured server &quot;The Kuni Corner.&quot;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>“I frequently have [members] of the community that are disabled — some with my same ailment of Fibromyalgia — check up on each other's physical and mental state,” Imakuni says. “Sometimes it's extremely rough, but banding together to talk about our disabilities helps us get through things easier because we know we're not alone.”</p>\n            <p>And of course, what’s a good streamer community without some games?

To date, we've paid out millions of dollars to thousands of creators and communities, and we're seeing more creators and communities earning on their Discord servers every day.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>For creators and communities who haven’t tried out these features yet, we’ve heard your feedback: you want more ideas on what to offer, more tools to add value to your subscriptions, and the ability to sell different types of products on Discord.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>\n            <p><strong>Today, we’re excited to share new tools that help you get started earning money faster.

Recently, we announced the addition of <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/introducing-video-screen-share-text-chat-support-for-stage-channels\">Video, Screen Sharing and Text in Voice in Stage Channels</a> and we’re already seeing communities offering a range of unique and intimate video streaming experiences for their Server Subscriptions, such as coaching sessions, Q&amp;A’s, or intimate weekly game streams. If you’re offering perks to your subscribers, it’s a good idea to ask your community for feedback from time to time to learn of their interests and customize your offerings accordingly. (They’re the ones paying, after all!)</p>\n            <p>With <strong>Tier Templates</strong>, getting started with Server Subscriptions has never been easier.<strong> </strong>Simply browse and select a template that best aligns with your desired price point, perk offerings and goals.

We know that talking with a family member or close friend in a DM is different from a group chat, and that a group chat is very different from participating in a community with millions of users. Discord enables each of these different forms of communication across the more than 9 million active servers on our platform, but we don’t take a one-size-fits-all approach to privacy and content moderation across all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>There have been a lot of questions and discussions recently about what it means to feel safe online, and how people should think about privacy on communications platforms like Discord. We want Discord to be a place where everyone can feel safe, find belonging, and hang out with the most important people in your lives.</p>\n            <p>Today we’re making some changes that clarify expectations and policies for different spaces on Discord. People use Discord in different ways for different experiences. By providing more information on how spaces are defined on Discord and what users can expect in different spaces, we’re empowering users to better control their Discord experience.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>That’s why today’s product update distinguishes among different spaces and provides enhanced server badges to make those spaces easier to identify, manage, and navigate. Here’s more detail on how we’re taking a tailored approach to safety and privacy on Discord:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong>Friend Spaces</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n            <p>Friend Servers (as well as direct messages and group direct messages) are invite-only spaces designed to talk and hang out with your friends or smaller groups. In these spaces, Discord:&nbsp;</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Responds to and investigates user reports about violations of our universal <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>.</li>\n                <li>Scans for known malware and spam.</li>\n                <li>Scans all files for Child Sexual Abuse Material and immediately reports any content and perpetrators to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the United States, which works with local law enforcement to take appropriate action.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>Provides users and <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044103531-role-of-administrators-and-moderators-on-discord\">administrators</a> with tools, including optional filters, to help them avoid unwanted content and undesirable behavior.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Starting today, new invite links for Friend Servers will expire at a maximum of 30 days. Any previously created non-expiring links will remain active and will still not expire.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Community Server</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n            <p><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312-Community-Server-Guidelines\">Community Servers</a> are invite-only spaces designed for people to talk, connect and learn from others who share a common interest. A server’s administrators must opt-in for their server to become a Community Server. In Community Servers with more than 200 members, we take a more proactive and automated approach to safety in line with our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>. In these spaces, Discord follows the same core procedures as those for Friend Servers and also:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>May use automated means to detect violations of our policies. For example, we may implement tools to help admins proactively detect and prevent coordinated spamming (raids). Since 2022, our AutoMod feature has automatically blocked more than 45 million unwanted messages from servers before they even had a chance to be posted, based on server rules.</li>\n                <li>Supports admins by giving them the ability to develop and enforce custom server rules in addition to Discord's <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h3><strong>Discoverable Server</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n            <p>Discoverable Servers are a subset of Community Servers that have met specific <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030843331-Enabling-Server-Discovery\">additional requirements</a> to appear in <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery\">Server Discovery</a>, making them more visible to potential members. Anyone on Discord can join these servers. In addition to the Community Server policies listed above, in these spaces Discord:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>May use posted content to help develop and improve features including <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5304469213079-Highlights-Notifications\">Highlights Notifications</a>. Any data we collect is in line with our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>. Those policies remain unchanged in today’s announcement.</li>\n                <li>May proactively identify harmful content on the platform and enforce our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>As we implement these changes, we are embracing four guiding principles.</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Users First</strong>. Discord is designed to empower users to control their own experience, including who you communicate with, which communities you join, and what topics and content you engage with. Similarly, our privacy and content controls are designed to match user expectations, with highest privacy delivered in smaller friend spaces and Discord and community administrators engaging in more content moderation in larger spaces that are open to a wider audience.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Transparency</strong>. We have an obligation to make clear to users at all times what space you’re in. We are <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078261239831\">deploying badges</a> to indicate Community, Partner, and Verified Servers. This extends our existing commitment to Transparency, reflected in our publication of detailed policies and guidelines for use of our service, our publication of quarterly <a href=\"https://discord.com/tags/transparency-reports\">Transparency Reports</a> with data and analysis on our content moderation actions, and blogs like this one.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Collaboration. </strong>Privacy and safety present nuanced issues and we know we can’t address them alone. That’s why we’re grateful to work with organizations including NCMEC, the Family Online Safety Institute, Tech Coalition, Crisis Text Line, the Digital Trust &amp; Safety Partnership, the Trust &amp; Safety Professionals Association, Connect Safely, AccessNow, and Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. And we’re always listening to and learning from our users.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Humility. </strong>Discord is a work-in-progress, so we will continue to evolve and grow. And as we do that, we will continue to listen to you and evolve our products and policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>We are committed to developing and implementing solutions that prioritize both privacy and safety. With these changes, we aim to advance that by enabling individual users to tailor their experience and enabling server admins to better engage with and safely grow their communities.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>For more information about these changes, please see our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078261239831\">Help Center article</a>.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

In the face of repression, discrimination and violence, Pride represents standing up for the fundamental equality of all people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>These values — equality, community, belonging — are the reason many people come to Discord. We strive to provide a platform to provide places to talk and where everyone can build genuine, meaningful relationships. LGBTQIA+ users and employees have been an essential part of Discord since our founding in 2015. We are proud that LGBTQIA+ people across the globe have used our service to talk, make friends, find support, establish meaningful relationships and build deep, lasting communities. We are particularly gratified when we hear that communities of Trans-identifying people have found Discord a safe space for important conversations and support.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>June is Pride Month, but Discord recognizes and celebrates Pride year-round, starting with our own workplace. We are committed to providing an environment where all employees belong. To support both our Pride ERG members and all Discord employees and their families, we’re proud to provide benefits including our Gender Affirmation Fund and a Medical Travel Fund to receive holistic care anywhere in the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>And while June is a time to celebrate Pride and acknowledge that the long arc of justice has moved forward since 1969, it is incredibly important to recognize we are in a moment where there are profoundly serious policy issues directed at the LGBTQIA+ community in the United States and around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Hate has no place on Discord. Making clear Discord’s position, we are proud to be a signatory to the <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/business-statement-on-anti-lgbtq-state-legislation\">Human Rights Campaign’s Business Statement</a>, which identifies and organizes leading businesses around the country to express opposition to policies targeting LGBTQIA+ people.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>This year, Discord will donate to <a href=\"https://transgenderlawcenter.org/\">The Transgender Law Center</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eqfl.org/\">Equality Florida</a>, two groups helping secure equity for Trans-identifying people. And to continue to stand with our employees on issues of equality impacting the LGBTQIA+ and Trans communities, we will also match all employee donations to those organizations.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Be Your True Self, Both on Discord and Around the World<br></strong></h2>\n            <p>To learn more about how Discord supports Inclusion, Diversity, and Purpose efforts and all of our Employee Benefits, including the Gender Affirmation Fund and Medical Travel Fund mentioned above, visit <a href=\"https://discord.com/careers#inclusion\">our Careers page</a>.

However, a quick news scan makes it clear that our collective ability to foster connection is facing unprecedented challenges. And few groups have felt these effects more than Generation Z.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>At Discord, creating community is our calling, and we take the responsibility of understanding the mental health of our users seriously. For so many people aged 13+ around the world, Discord is <em>the</em> place to hang out and connect authentically. As a communications platform that does not generate revenue through ads or benefit from attention-grabbing algorithmic news feeds, we’ve created something special for our users: a truly customizable experience that allows them to bond over shared interests and find community. And because of that, we feel a deep responsibility to make our platform as welcoming, inclusive, and helpful as possible.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>We know that young people are dealing with real challenges: In the U.S., nearly half of adolescents will experience a mental illness at some point in their lives. There is a new world of friendship being nurtured online, and Discord is using its place as a leader in that space to unpack the benefits, implications, and challenges Gen Z faces in their quest for mental well-being in their daily lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>To better understand the context in which our users are living and to evaluate our role in contributing to solving the youth mental health crisis, we went straight to the source.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In honor of Mental Health Awareness Month, we recently surveyed 1,000 members of Gen Z adults aged 18 to 25 and 1,000 parents of Gen Zers to get their perspectives on the issue. Here’s what we found:&nbsp;</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Stress </strong>and <strong>anxiety </strong>are the No.1 emotions felt by today’s Gen Zers, outweighing feelings of love, happiness, and hope.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li><strong>Almost half (43%) rate their mental and emotional health as poor, with just as many (44%) citing uncertainty about the future.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n                <li><strong>Over half (55%) say their mental and emotional health has taken a turn for the worse in the past few years.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n                <li>There is broad <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html\">agreement</a> among the scientific community that social media has the potential to both benefit and harm children and adolescents. Our survey found that<strong> although some say participation on social media and community platforms contributes to poor mental health, more report that online communications platforms, including social media, play a positive role in their life, providing a welcome source of entertainment, a nice distraction from life’s responsibilities, and a place to feel connected.</strong></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Stressed, anxious, hopeless, and unsure, Gen Z feels the weight of the world on their shoulders. Coupled with feelings of isolation and loneliness, the way forward is unclear to them, whether that’s who to ask for help, where to seek it, or how to afford it. Addressing these issues is equally complicated, with several stats surfacing problematic gaps and assumptions that impede progress:  &nbsp;<br></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Just 30% of parents say their Gen Zer’s emotional/mental health has taken a turn for the worse over the past several years, while 55% of Gen Z say this.</strong></li>\n                <li><strong>The vast majority of Gen Z believe in the power and wisdom of seeking mental health support when needed; but at the same time, 35% still consider suffering from mental health problems as a sign of weakness. </strong>&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Further, 40% feel that today’s attention to mental health is a trend that will likely subside in the coming years, contributing to larger feelings of hopelessness. </strong>&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Click below to read the full white paper, “<strong><em>MIND MATTERS: Bridging Gaps to Support Gen Z’s Mental Health</em>.” </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed\">\n                <div class=\"btn-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/zplryoxi7llp1jb/MIND%20MATTERS%3A%20Bridging%20Gaps%20to%20Support%20Gen%20Z%E2%80%99s%20Mental%20Health.pdf?dl=0\" class=\"btn-blog w-button\" target=\"_blank\">Read the White Paper</a></div>\n            </div>\n            <p>From this research, we’ve learned that we have a lot of work to do to stay true to our mission. Gen Z has had a tough go of it over the last couple of years, and it is no surprise that feelings of hopelessness, isolation, loneliness, and anxiety are so widely shared. At Discord, we are committing to finding ways to better support users facing mental health obstacles–here’s a glimpse of how:&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Cultivating a Supportive Platform&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n            <p>Now more than ever, conversations once reserved for face-to-face interactions are happening online, necessitating robust mental health resources in these spaces. Platforms like Discord can provide the safety and anonymity that some seek when discussing topics like identity, sexuality, and mental health. Gen Z deserves such spaces, and Discord is working to ensure they feel supported on our platform by doing the following:  <br></p>\n            <p><strong><em>Forming intentional and impactful partnerships&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Discord maintains a partnership with <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\">Crisis Text Line</a> to enable users to get the help they need for themselves or empower others to get help, as quickly as possible. Discord chose Crisis Text Line as a partner because they are available 24/7, and allow teens and adolescents to anonymously seek support in a way that can be easier and more approachable.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>We’re also a proud supporter of the <a href=\"https://digitalwellnesslab.org/\">Digital Wellness Lab</a> at Boston Children’s Hospital, whose work helps ground our approach to teen safety and belonging in the latest scientific research and best practices.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>And we’re empowering teens and families to build belonging online through our <a href=\"https://www.pta.org/home/programs/connected/build-belonging\">partnership with the National PTA</a> to help families and educators discuss ways to foster positive relationships and build belonging in our digital world.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p><strong><em>Crafting and refining supportive policies&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Finding a community that is navigating similar challenges can be incredibly helpful for healing. That said, we know that online communications platforms have a critical role to play to ensure digital spaces don’t attempt to normalize or promote hurtful behaviors or encourage other users to engage in acts of self-harm. We recently <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work\">expanded</a> our Self Harm Encouragement and Promotion Policy to ensure this content is addressed on Discord.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>At the company level, Discord will soon appoint a Mental Health Policy Manager to oversee all future efforts, partnerships, and policies to bolster users’ mental health on and off the platform.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p><strong><em>Joining the conversation&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Parents, educators, policymakers, and industry alike must rally to rectify the plight young people currently face, and collaboration is demanded of all of us. Collective, cross-sector research would help reveal the whole of the problem, establishing the path forward for better-informed solution-making. In participating in these efforts, we can help reshape negative stereotypes and stigmas that continue to surround mental health, rewriting norms and eliminating obstacles to learning about and securing care.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Discord is deeply committed to this work. With these learnings in mind, we will continue driving thoughtful conversations through targeted action, collaborations, and partnerships with organizations such as Crisis Text Line, the Digital Wellness Lab, and the National PTA.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>But for us, acknowledging the extent of the issue is just the beginning. At Discord, we’ll move forward, committed to helping to bridge the gap between Gen Z and the mental health resources they deserve by meeting them where they already are.</p>\n            <p>If you or someone you know is facing a mental health crisis, seek support today by texting DISCORD to 741741, or learn more about Crisis Text Line <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7925648993943-Crisis-Text-Line\">here</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>To learn more about the study’s findings, view the report <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/zplryoxi7llp1jb/MIND%20MATTERS%3A%20Bridging%20Gaps%20to%20Support%20Gen%20Z%E2%80%99s%20Mental%20Health.pdf?dl=0\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

Yeah, I BET you do. Have you ever wanted to ping “@todos?” Share a message to “@tout le monde” or even “@みんな?” Well, none of those variations of the @everyone ping will actually work in Discord, but after learning a new language with Memrise, you’ll be able to talk to anyone and @everyone, no matter what language they speak!&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1080pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/647672d3a166cbbaec5d3628_6fe868ca.png\" alt=\"Promotional imagery for Memrise.

By using Motivation’s aptly-named “<strong>/motivation”</strong> command, you’ll be able to share a bit of inspiration in the form of a motivational quote.

We made it so now you know where it takes you.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li>\n                <li><strong>Preview uploaded media before you send it. </strong>You can also cancel an upload without clearing the whole message and having to start over.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

Display Names are being added so how you appear to other users stays the same. We will be assigning priority to choose your new username based on when you registered for Discord, Nitro status, and ownership of partner and verified servers. For more information see our Help Center article </em><a href=\"https://dis.gd/usernames\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n            <p>Way back when Jason and I first built Discord in 2015, there were only a handful of us working on the product and I was personally responsible for designing and programming our username and identity systems. We were building Discord as a place to hang out with our friends while playing games. Back then I was playing Final Fantasy XIV and it was important to me that I show up in the Discord server as my in-game character. Years later, I spend most nights still hanging out in voice while playing FFXIV (maybe a little <em>too</em> much lol). Being able to be myself in these spaces and seeing others do the same is something I care about.</p>\n            <p>Starting this month, however, we’re making some big changes to how usernames and identities work on our platform.</p>\n            <p>The whole point of these changes is that we want to make it a lot easier for you and all the new users coming to Discord to connect and hang out with friends. And as Discord’s Co-Founder, I wanted to talk about these changes personally. We know that your username and identity are important, and we understand that some of you may not like this change and disagree with it. We know that this is an issue you feel strongly about.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We also recognize that our current username format has been one of the things that makes Discord unique, and that this change makes our usernames look a lot like those on other platforms. To be blunt, that’s kind of the point. These weren’t easy decisions, and we didn’t come to them lightly. We’ve put a lot of thought into this (like…<em> a lot</em>), so I’d like to walk through how we got here and what’s going to happen next.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How We Got Here</strong></h2>\n            <p>When we were first building Discord, one of our top priorities was to let you give yourself just about any name you wanted, join your friend’s server and hop on voice chat quickly and easily. We didn’t want people to ever hit a screen that said “Your Desired Username is Taken.” We also allowed usernames to be case-sensitive because originally, we didn’t even have a friend system, so no one had to type usernames manually. This became technical debt that we didn’t address adequately.</p>\n            <p>Meanwhile, as Discord grew, we got a ton of requests to let people chat with one another even if they no longer shared a server, so we created a friend system. To make sure everything still worked, we exposed the four-digit suffix called a “discriminator.” With those four digits, “PhiBi#8936” could be differentiated from “PhiBi#9863”.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How Usernames Ended Up After Eight Years</strong></h2>\n            <p>As Discord has grown and friending has become more popular, more problems have emerged. The technical and product debt we incurred years ago caught up with us and small issues that seemed to impact a few people started affecting tens of millions of people. <strong>The biggest problem: our current usernames can often be too complicated or obscure for people to remember and share easily</strong>.</p>\n            <p>We've heard from tons of people that they've run into problems like these:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>You try to share your username outside of Discord. Unfortunately, you either can’t remember the discriminator, have to explain which letters are uppercase and lowercase, or have to try to specify which special characters your name uses.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>You meet someone IRL that you want to talk to on Discord, and they say “I’m Phibi Eight Nine Three Six!” You go home and add “phibi#8936” only to find out you added the wrong “Phibi” because your new friend’s username is actually “PhIBI#8936”.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>You want to use a common name like “Mike” or “Jane” but there are already 9,999 Mikes or Janes so you’re blocked from that name altogether.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>You like to change your username a lot and get rate limited.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Your friend says they changed their name to “vernacular” but actually it’s “𝖛𝖊𝖗𝖓𝖆𝖈𝖚𝖑𝖆𝖗” and you have trouble finding them.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>We spoke with a lot of you about how you add one another as friends and crunched some numbers. It turns out that:&nbsp;</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>More than 40% of you</strong> either don’t remember your discriminator or <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1311wal/what_is_this_code_called/\">don’t even know what a discriminator is</a>. That’s a big problem when discriminators are <em>required</em> to add a new friend.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Across Discord, <strong>almost half of all friend requests fail to connect the user with the person they wanted to match with</strong>, mostly because users enter an incorrect or invalid username due to a combination of missing discriminator and incorrect casing.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>This isn’t a great experience, and we want to fix it. We want Discord to be a fun, easy place to hang out with friends, and it’s often just too difficult or complicated to connect with the people you care about.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How We Approached the Problem</strong></h2>\n            <p>We have considered <em>many</em> potential solutions to these issues and most ended up being “halfway” fixes that didn’t solve the fundamental difficulty of easily remembering and sharing your identity with friends.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Here’s an example:</p>\n            <p>We decided at one point that the most important issue to solve was case-sensitivity and special characters, so there could be only one phibi#8936, instead of allowing permutations like PhIBI#8936, and PHibi#8936.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Unfortunately, we found that nearly one-third of our active users would be forced to change their name just to accommodate this. Meanwhile, people from regions where non-alphanumeric characters are common in names, such as Asia, would have difficulty fully representing themselves.</p>\n            <p>So then we considered making that change but also enabling a separate global Display Name that could include special characters, a bit like how server nicknames work currently. But we realized that then we would have an even <em>more</em> complex system with both a Display Name and a username that still included the four-digit discriminator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We came to the conclusion that if we were going to ask a lot of our users to make a change, we needed a more comprehensive and robust long-term solution - one that gives people the power to have a Display Name they can change anytime with very relaxed rate limits. Think of them like a global nickname.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How We’re Improving Usernames on Discord</strong></h2>\n            <p>After we transition over the course of this year, everyone will have:</p>\n            <p>1) A unique alphanumeric<strong> username</strong> without a discriminator, such as “phibi”. Think of this merely as a technical necessity. This username will be used only for connecting with other users (friending) and telling users apart when you check their profiles. They’ll be limited to lowercase characters (a-z), numbers (0-9) and two special characters (period and underscore). They’ll be much easier to remember, verbalize and share with your friends. You’ll be able to continue to change your username, but not too frequently.</p>\n            <p>2) A non-unique <strong>Display Name</strong> that can include just about anything (as long as it adheres to our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>), including special characters, spaces, emojis and non-Latin characters. Your new Display Name will be <strong>how you primarily appear</strong> and will be your most prominent form of identity. Think of this as your main name. You will be able to change your Display Name whenever you want, even minute to minute.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>By default, your new Display Name will be your old username without the discriminator, <strong>so your friends continue to recognize you</strong>. So if you used to be “PhiBi#8936”, your new default Display Name will be “PhiBi”. Here’s an example:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1106pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/645c2a012698cf52d94bbb25_Username%20example.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A Discord profile with a new username. Their username is now &quot;phibiscool,&quot; and their display name is &quot;PhiBi.&quot;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>In addition, your previous username and discriminator will continue to work as an alias after the conversion process is done, so old friends who don’t know your new username yet will continue to be able to add you.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>And for the developers out there, while numerical User IDs will remain the same, learn more about some other changes that may impact your Apps <a href=\"https://dis.gd/app-usernames\">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>If you already use a Server Nickname in a particular community, that Server Nickname will still take priority over your Display Name in that server.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How We’re Rolling Out New Usernames</strong></h2>\n            <p>In the coming weeks, we’ll begin notifying users when they’re able to update their account to a new username, so be on the lookout for an in-app prompt when it’s your turn.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>During the transition, all Discord users will be asked to choose a new username, and access will roll out slowly over the course of several months. We want to be particularly considerate of longtime Discord users who have had their usernames for quite awhile, so we will be assigning priority to choose your new username based on when you registered for Discord.&nbsp;In terms of rollout, we’re starting with access to owners of partner and verified servers, then to all users based on the age of their account in the coming months, starting with 2015. Current Nitro subscribers paying for the ability to customize their discriminator that registered for Nitro on or before March 1, 2023 will also be given early access.</p>\n            <p>We recognize that this is a big change. There may be hiccups with this process, and it may be tough to part ways with that “#0001” that’s meant a lot to you over the years. We’ll be doing everything we can to manage things as smoothly as possible.</p>\n            <p>Jason and I truly believe this is the right thing to do to help more people hang out with their friends on Discord, which is what we’re all about.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Thank you for being part of Discord.

In both countries, I was able to connect with local members of the community who guided me in my work, as well as ultimately meet them in person during these meetups!”</p>\n            <p>One of Aria’s server admins puts it best: “Aria's presence in his content as well as the server assists people to look beyond their location and into the world around them to learn everything there is to know. Be it a new place they never knew, a new way of life, or a new story, Aria's worked hard to cultivate a self-sustaining atmosphere of learning and constant curiosity.”</p>\n            <p>If this sounds like an Aria on Discord that feels perfect for you, you’ll find ARIA 51 and his “wolf pack” in Server Discovery. 🐺<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Supporting AANHPI Communities Within &amp; Outside Discord<br></strong></h2>\n            <p>We’re committed to supporting and advocating for organizations that help create an inclusive, equitable world for the AANHPI community.

Sometimes they’ll add a popular moderation App from the <a href=\"https://discord.com/application-directory\">App Directory</a>, while others go as far as building their own App for their unique use-case.</p>\n            <p>When every community has their own method to verify, newcomers might be confused, or even overwhelmed and depart before saying hello. Even experienced Discord members may struggle as they try and figure out how a particular server handles their gating methods.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Enter <strong>Community</strong> <strong>Onboarding</strong>: Now, every Community Server can opt to use a simple survey that guides new members through your server's roles and channels. It’s easy to understand, inviting, and lets newcomers feel both welcomed and well-oriented to hit the ground running.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1920pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/643ef58d99d2c21e24ca8c6b_onboarding-mobile-horizontal-gif.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"An animated GIF demonstrating how Discord’s new Onboarding feature works.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <p>Since Onboarding is built directly into Discord rather than requiring users to interact with a community-created App, your moderation team can ensure your server's own first impression is welcoming and intuitive. Your newest members will spend less time figuring out server entry and more time enjoying your server, paving the way for meaningful interactions and a sense of belonging.</p>\n            <p>Setting up Onboarding requires just three simple steps:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Select <strong>Default Channels</strong> everyone sees in their channel list upon joining.</li>\n                <li>Create <strong>Questions</strong> to help members choose additional channels and roles.</li>\n                <li>Link answers to <strong>channels</strong> and <strong>roles</strong>.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Even after you select Default Channels shown for @everyone, <strong>any person entering your community will have to complete onboarding before they can post in your community.</strong> You can require all your Onboarding questions to be answered or let certain questions be optional. If your server has Rules Screening, prospective members will have to <em>also</em> complete Rules Screening after Onboarding.&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <p>For the full scoop on Onboarding, all its requirements, and more details on how to enable it, head on over to the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ\">Onboarding Help Center article</a>.

At the press (and hold) of a button, you’ll be able to send a quick little quip to a friend without having to hop in Voice to hear it. They’re faster when you just wanna “say the thing you wanna say” quickly, and Voice Messages harness the power of Krisp noise cancellation to block out background noise, making you sound just as good as you do in-person.</p>\n            <p>They’re also a great way to hear a friend’s Voice and have a more personal conversation without the stress of starting a “formal” Voice call.

The appearance of these documents on our platform was unusual – conversations on Discord generally relate to video games, music, art, sports, and other interests of our users around the world. </p>\n            <p>Classified military intelligence documents pose a significant, complex challenge for Discord as they do for other online platforms – only authorized government personnel can determine whether a document is classified, unclassified, or even authentic. And currently, there is no structured process for the government to communicate their determinations to platforms like Discord. &nbsp;</p>\n            <p>However, what is clear is that unauthorized disclosure of classified government documents violates Discord’s <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a>, which prohibit the posting of illegal content on our platform. Because of this, in connection with this incident, we have removed content, terminated user accounts, and are cooperating with the efforts of the United States Departments of Defense and Justice in their investigation of this incident. And, while a suspect has been arrested, we continue to conduct our own internal investigation of these events.</p>\n            <p>Discord is a communications platform that brings people together over shared experiences. More than 150 million people around the world use our platform every month to stay in touch and spend time with the most important people in their lives. </p>\n            <p>The safety of all the people and communities that call Discord their online home is a top priority. Posting illegal content or demonstrating racist behavior, both observed in this incident, are not welcome or allowed on Discord. </p>\n            <p>Below is a summary of what we can share about the recent incident, including actions taken and more details around our practices.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

Emojis and Stickers encapsulate anything from the latest popular memes to in-jokes that only your community would understand, and Soundboard is the audio version of this type of expression.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>To upload a new Soundboard sound, you’ll either need the “Manage Server” permission or own the server you’d like to upload a sound to.

Super-Lemon. Your favorite streamer’s pog emoji? Super-Pog. The incredibly low-resolution animated emoji that’s actually a 15-minute video clip you managed to shove into the 256 KB emoji file limit?

Wouldn’t all these messages get bombarded with confetti and decoration if every reaction can be animated?” Well, with great abilities comes… uh… being reasonable with it, I think is the right phrase.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Anyways, it’s all about using your Super Reactions responsibly: <strong>Discord Nitro members get to use 5 Super Reactions per week, and Nitro Basic or Nitro Classic members will get to use 2 per week.</strong> When next week rolls around, you’ll get another batch of Super Reactions to use, and the Super Reactions you didn’t get to use last week will roll over.

In addition, you can’t use ‘em in DMs or Group DMs — they’re for use on servers only, where many friends can enjoy their beauty!&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>And be nice about using your Super Reactions! If a community admin in the server you used your Super Reaction thinks your reaction usage wasn’t in-line with their rules, they can use their moderator powers to remove your Super Reaction, just like any other reaction. You can also remove it yourself, but in either scenario, you won’t get your credit returned once it’s removed.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Looking for some super guidance on Super Reactions?

Midjourney’s server is the biggest on Discord, with more than 13 million members bringing their imaginations to pixels. Overall, our users have created more than 1 billion unique images through AI apps on Discord. And this is just the start.</p>\n            <p>Almost 3 million Discord servers include an AI experience, ranging from generating gaming assets to groups writing novels with AI, to AI companions, AI companies and AI-based learning communities. More than 10 percent of new Discord users are joining specifically to access AI interest based communities on our platform.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Why is Discord becoming the home for AI? Simple: on Discord you can enjoy AI <em>with friends</em>. Rather than just going solo with an app, you and your friends can see what sorts of exciting, wild and sometimes silly results come from prompts like “robo-hamster caught in cardboard box, renaissance painting.” (Sorry, Nelly.)</p>\n            <p>On Discord, you can use AI to supercharge your conversation with friends – you can brainstorm together, create together, make memes together. It’s both entertainment and utility, fun and informative.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>And as a developer myself, what’s really exciting is seeing how teams and communities use our platform as their sandbox and build AI services directly on Discord. Open source teams are prototyping new models with early community members in Discord servers, and AI fans are sharing their favorite large language model prompts with each other. For example, the creators of Stable Diffusion, the popular open-source image model, first met and collaborated in a Discord community.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We work hard to ensure that everyone on Discord is able to do all of this in a safe, positive environment and are committed to protecting the privacy and data of our users. Our AI features use OpenAI technology, but OpenAI cannot use Discord user data to train its general models. Like other Discord products, these features can only store and use information as described in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy#3\">Privacy Policy,</a> and they do not record, store, or use any voice or video call content from users. Rest assured, if our policy ever changes, we will disclose that to our users in advance of any implementation.</p>\n            <p>Today, we’re sharing a few new things about AI on Discord:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Three really cool AI experiences we’re launching as free public experiments in a limited number of servers: Clyde, AutoMod AI, and Conversation Summaries</li>\n                <li>Two sneak previews of future AI explorations we’re excited about: Avatar Remix and a whiteboard with AI prototype</li>\n                <li>News about a new Discord AI Incubator to help fund innovative AI startups<br>‍</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Clyde</strong></h2>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6408f79bb2fe323967637478_8WEd2cAS2QIVOIgZWvVRUrf6J1-3-4MR7XFihEAO3DI3L3Tfr66iReD5OpmHar37_DS_dW9-Xa95CFcJPG-7HJq9VQNZkzEjYIXozkD2LZxTVSrLv4_elji1RQ3e68d2uhM6J9NIPT2ECojKsiTDVhk.png\" alt=\"A user interacting with Cylde within their Discord server.

Throughout Discord, you may already see Clyde responding to slash commands or DMing you if you’ve made an error.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>And next week, Clyde is coming to (artificially intelligent) life, natively within Discord, using OpenAI technology. Clyde can now answer questions and have extended conversations with you and your friends. Just by typing @Clyde in a server, you can chat with Clyde in any channel. You can even have Clyde start a thread for a group of your friends to hang out. Clyde can recommend playlists, and access GIFs and emojis like any Discord user.</p>\n            <p>Clyde is designed to help friends hang out, with a privacy-first and optional-only approach. While our AI features use OpenAI technology, OpenAI cannot use Discord user data to train its general models. Like any other Discord feature, Clyde can only store and use information as described in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>, and Clyde can only access messages sent directly to it or sent in a thread it created. We also ensured that Clyde does not record, store or use any voice or video call data from users.</p>\n            <p>Clyde is learning interesting and fun new things every day, and we’re excited to continue testing and iterating so Clyde becomes a fundamental part of the Discord experience soon.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>AutoMod&nbsp;AI</strong></h2>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6408f7edca3f6105bbdaa328_wTwZ_DiY57VueKnFsSSwbli_nM9ZqCaqP1U_-2AWs8bR9k_Z4rjdab5kekV0ACPBVpGncXcNhXlZq-R2Oeqk2hfKrDOGLsv2DiG2C_ZBt9PcdPdeZQzgM5QLPixFFVTHJ12CMrWThhMFxnB8kFYAIfs.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of AutoMod AI. AutoMod is reviewing messages and flagging them to moderators.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Next up is AutoMod AI. Last year we introduced AutoMod to take some of the load off of manually moderating a server. To date, AutoMod has automatically blocked more than 45 million unwanted messages from servers before they even had a chance to be posted based on server rules.</p>\n            <p>Now we’re taking AutoMod to the next level, harnessing the power of large language models. Moderators can leverage Automod AI, which will use OpenAI technology to find and alert the moderator whenever server rules may have been broken. The AutoMod AI experiment begins in a limited number of servers today. Server admins can choose to enable this feature, and they can turn it off at any time. While AutoMod AI uses OpenAI technology, OpenAI cannot use Discord user data to train its general models.

This feature can be enabled in Server Settings and we’ll be experimenting with Conversation Summaries in a limited number of servers starting next week.

We knew we’d be growing, and we did!</p>\n            <p>We wanted a database that grew alongside us, but hopefully, its maintenance needs wouldn’t grow alongside our storage needs. Unfortunately, we found that to not be the case — our Cassandra cluster exhibited serious performance issues that required increasing amounts of effort to just maintain, not improve.</p>\n            <p>Almost six years later, we’ve changed a lot, and how we store messages has changed as well.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>Our Cassandra Troubles</h2>\n            <p>We stored our messages in a database called cassandra-messages. As its name suggests, it ran Cassandra, and it stored messages. In 2017, we ran 12 Cassandra nodes, storing billions of messages.</p>\n            <p>At the beginning of 2022, it had 177 nodes with trillions of messages. To our chagrin, it was a high-toil system — our on-call team was frequently paged for issues with the database, latency was unpredictable, and we were having to cut down on maintenance operations that became too expensive to run.</p>\n            <p>What was causing these issues? First, let’s take a look at a message.</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-script\">\n                <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/DiscordBlog/ce8615e96a5002fbaf401678064c0ab8.js\"></script>\n            </div>\n            <p>The CQL statement above is a minimal version of our message schema. Every ID we use is a <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake\">Snowflake</a>, making it chronologically sortable. We partition our messages by the channel they’re sent in, along with a bucket, which is a static time window. This partitioning means that, in Cassandra, all messages for a given channel and bucket will be stored together and replicated across three nodes (or whatever you’ve set the replication factor).</p>\n            <p>Within this partitioning lies a potential performance pitfall: a server with just a small group of friends tends to send orders of magnitude fewer messages than a server with hundreds of thousands of people.</p>\n            <p>In Cassandra, reads are more expensive than writes. Writes are appended to a commit log and written to an in memory structure called a memtable that is eventually flushed to disk. Reads, however, need to query the memtable and potentially multiple SSTables (on-disk files), a more expensive operation. Lots of concurrent reads as users interact with servers can hotspot a partition, which we refer to imaginatively as a “hot partition”. &nbsp;The size of our dataset when combined with these access patterns led to struggles for our cluster.</p>\n            <p>When we encountered a hot partition, it frequently affected latency across our entire database cluster. One channel and bucket pair received a large amount of traffic, and latency in the node would increase as the node tried harder and harder to serve traffic and fell further and further behind.</p>\n            <p>Other queries to this node were affected as the node couldn’t keep up. Since we perform reads and writes with quorum consistency level, all queries to the nodes that serve the hot partition suffer latency increases, resulting in broader end-user impact.</p>\n            <p>Cluster maintenance tasks also frequently caused trouble. We were prone to falling behind on compactions, where Cassandra would compact SSTables on disk for more performant reads. Not only were our reads then more expensive, but we’d also see cascading latency as a node tried to compact.</p>\n            <p>We frequently performed an operation we called the “gossip dance”, where we’d take a node out of rotation to let it compact without taking traffic, bring it back in to pick up hints from Cassandra’s hinted handoff, and then repeat until the compaction backlog was empty. We also spent a large amount of time tuning the JVM’s garbage collector and heap settings, because GC pauses would cause significant latency spikes.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>Changing Our Architecture</h2>\n            <p>Our messages cluster wasn’t our only Cassandra database. We had several other clusters, and each exhibited similar (though perhaps not as severe) faults.</p>\n            <p>In our <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-billions-of-messages\">previous iteration of this post</a>, we mentioned being intrigued by ScyllaDB, a Cassandra-compatible database written in C++. Its promise of better performance, faster repairs, stronger workload isolation via its shard-per-core architecture, and a garbage collection-free life sounded quite appealing.</p>\n            <p>Although ScyllaDB is most definitely not void of issues, it is void of a garbage collector, since it’s written in C++ rather than Java. Historically, our team has had many issues with the garbage collector on Cassandra, from GC pauses affecting latency, all the way to super long consecutive GC pauses that got so bad that an operator would have to manually reboot and babysit the node in question back to health. These issues were a huge source of on-call toil, and the root of many stability issues within our messages cluster.</p>\n            <p>After experimenting with ScyllaDB and observing improvements in testing, we made the decision to migrate all of our databases. While this decision could be a blog post in itself, the short version is that by 2020, we had migrated every database but one to ScyllaDB.</p>\n            <p>The last one? Our friend, cassandra-messages.</p>\n            <p>Why hadn’t we migrated it yet? To start with, it’s a big cluster. With trillions of messages and nearly 200 nodes, any migration was going to be an involved effort. Additionally, we wanted to make sure our new database could be the best it could be as we worked to tune its performance. We also wanted to gain more experience with ScyllaDB in production, using it in anger and learning its pitfalls.</p>\n            <p>We also worked to improve ScyllaDB performance for our use cases. In our testing, we discovered that the performance of reverse queries was insufficient for our needs. We execute a reverse query when we attempt a database scan in the opposite order of a table’s sorting, such as when we scan messages in ascending order. The ScyllaDB team prioritized improvements and implemented performant reverse queries, removing the last database blocker in our migration plan.</p>\n            <p>We were suspicious that slapping a new database on our system wasn’t going to make everything magically better. Hot partitions can still be a thing in ScyllaDB, and so we also wanted to invest in improving our systems upstream of the database to help shield and facilitate better database performance.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>Data Services Serving Data</h2>\n            <p>With Cassandra, we struggled with hot partitions. High traffic to a given partition resulted in unbounded concurrency, leading to cascading latency in which subsequent queries would continue to grow in latency. If we could control the amount of concurrent traffic to hot partitions, we could protect the database from being overwhelmed.</p>\n            <p>To accomplish this task, we wrote what we refer to as data services — intermediary services that sit between our API monolith and our database clusters. When writing our data services, we chose a language we’ve been using <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust\">more and more at Discord</a>: Rust! We’d used it for a few projects previously, and it lived up to the hype for us. It gave us fast C/C++ speeds without having to sacrifice safety.</p>\n            <p>Rust touts fearless concurrency as one of its main benefits — the language should make it easy to write safe, concurrent code. Its libraries also were a great match for what we were intending to accomplish. The <a href=\"https://tokio.rs/\">Tokio ecosystem</a> is a tremendous foundation for building a system on asynchronous I/O, and the language has driver support for both Cassandra and ScyllaDB.</p>\n            <p>Additionally, we found it a joy to code in with the help the compiler gives you, the clarity of the error messages, the language constructs, and its emphasis on safety. We became quite fond of how once it compiled, it generally works. Most importantly, however, it lets us say we rewrote it in Rust (meme cred is very important).</p>\n            <p>Our data services sit between the API and our ScyllaDB clusters. They contain roughly one gRPC endpoint per database query and intentionally contain no business logic. The big feature our data services provide is request coalescing. If multiple users are requesting the same row at the same time, we’ll only query the database once. The first user that makes a request causes a worker task to spin up in the service. Subsequent requests will check for the existence of that task and subscribe to it. That worker task will query the database and return the row to all subscribers.</p>\n            <p>This is the power of Rust in action: it made it easy to write safe concurrent code.</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1806px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6406629e7ba3569d3c32c8ed_Example%201%402x.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Let’s imagine a big announcement on a large server that notifies @everyone: users are going to open the app and read the message, sending tons of traffic to the database. Previously, this might lead to a hot partition, and on-call would potentially need to be paged to help the system recover. With our data services, we’re able to significantly reduce traffic spikes against the database.</p>\n            <p>The second part of the magic here is upstream of our data services. We implemented consistent hash-based routing to our data services to enable more effective coalescing. For each request to our data service, we provide a routing key. For messages, this is a channel ID, so all requests for the same channel go to the same instance of the service. This routing further helps reduce the load on our database.</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1806px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/640662a51e3e13599d292404_Example%202%402x.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>These improvements help a lot, but they don’t solve all of our problems. We’re still seeing hot partitions and increased latency on our Cassandra cluster, just not quite as frequently. It buys us some time so that we can prepare our new optimal ScyllaDB cluster and execute the migration.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>A Very Big Migration</h2>\n            <p>Our requirements for our migration are quite straightforward: we need to migrate trillions of messages with no downtime, and we need to do it quickly because while the Cassandra situation has somewhat improved, we’re frequently firefighting.</p>\n            <p>Step one is easy: we provision a new ScyllaDB cluster using our <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-supercharges-network-disks-for-extreme-low-latency\">super-disk storage topology</a>. By using Local SSDs for speed and leveraging RAID to mirror our data to a persistent disk, we get the speed of attached local disks with the durability of a persistent disk. With our cluster stood up, we can begin migrating data into it.</p>\n            <p>Our first draft of our migration plan was designed to get value quickly. We’d start using our shiny new ScyllaDB cluster for newer data using a cutover time, and then migrate historical data behind it. It adds more complexity, but what every large project needs is additional complexity, right?</p>\n            <p>We begin dual-writing new data to Cassandra and ScyllaDB and concurrently begin to provision ScyllaDB’s Spark migrator. It requires a lot of tuning, and once we get it set up, we have an estimated time to completion: three months.</p>\n            <p>That timeframe doesn’t make us feel warm and fuzzy inside, and we’d prefer to get value faster. We sit down as a team and brainstorm ways we can speed things up, until we remember that we’ve written a fast and performant database library that we could potentially extend. We elect to engage in some meme-driven engineering and rewrite the data migrator in Rust.</p>\n            <p>In an afternoon, we extended our data service library to perform large-scale data migrations. It reads token ranges from a database, checkpoints them locally via SQLite, and then firehoses them into ScyllaDB. We hook up our new and improved migrator and get a new estimate: nine days! If we can migrate data this quickly, then we can forget our complicated time-based approach and instead flip the switch for everything at once.</p>\n            <p>We turn it on and leave it running, migrating messages at speeds of up to 3.2 million per second. Several days later, we gather to watch it hit 100%, and we realize that it’s stuck at 99.9999% complete (no, really). Our migrator is timing out reading the last few token ranges of data because they contain gigantic ranges of tombstones that were never compacted away in Cassandra. We compact that token range, and seconds later, the migration is complete!</p>\n            <p>We performed automated data validation by sending a small percentage of reads to both databases and comparing results, and everything looked great. The cluster held up well with full production traffic, whereas Cassandra was suffering increasingly frequent latency issues. We gathered together at our team onsite, flipped the switch to make ScyllaDB the primary database, and ate celebratory cake!<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>Several Months Later…</h2>\n            <p>We switched our messages database over in May 2022, but how’s it held up since then?</p>\n            <p>It’s been a quiet, well-behaved database (it’s okay to say this because I’m not on-call this week). We’re not having weekend-long firefights, nor are we juggling nodes in the cluster to attempt to preserve uptime. It’s a much more efficient database — we’re going from running 177 Cassandra nodes to just 72 ScyllaDB nodes. Each ScyllaDB node has 9 TB of disk space, up from the average of 4 TB per Cassandra node.</p>\n            <p>Our tail latencies have also improved drastically. For example, fetching historical messages had a p99 of between 40-125ms on Cassandra, with ScyllaDB having a nice and chill 15ms p99 latency, and message insert performance going from 5-70ms p99 on Cassandra, to a steady 5ms p99 on ScyllaDB. Thanks to the aforementioned performance improvements, we’ve unlocked new product use cases now that we have confidence in our messages database.</p>\n            <p>At the end of 2022, people all over the world tuned in to watch the World Cup. One thing we discovered very quickly was that goals scored showed up in our monitoring graphs. This was very cool because not only is it neat to see real-world events show up in your systems, but this gave our team an excuse to watch soccer during meetings. We weren’t “watching soccer during meetings”, we were “proactively monitoring our systems’ performance.”</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1536pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6406587246a8ce1cfe8f105f_Screen%20Shot%202023-02-27%20at%205.44.56%20PM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>We can actually tell the story of the World Cup Final via our message send graph.

Stage channels help bring the focus to a small handful of people to bring your community event to life, removing the need to mute or unmute dozens of people talking over each other in a single Voice channel.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Since then, millions of Stage channels have been created on Discord for community members&nbsp; to come together and hold conversations, record podcasts, host community AMAs and interviews with creators, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/behind-the-curtain-how-three-discord-communities-found-success-in-stage-events\">anything in-between</a> in a space that’s easily manageable by your server admins.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Today, Stages are getting a huge upgrade to truly encompass the idea of having the spotlight shine on you: <strong>Stage channels are gaining video, screen sharing, and text chat support. </strong>These additions to Stage channels will<strong> </strong>finally<strong> </strong>let you show off in front of your virtual audience or screen share a visual aid when presenting, and your community will have a place to banter, comment, and flood chat with pog emojis when something exciting happens.&nbsp;</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-iframe\">\n                <center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zabdmpYznnU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></center>\n            </div>\n            <p>Any Discord server that has the “Community” feature set enabled (<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server\">it’s free!</a>) will be able to hop on video or use screen share in Stages with up to 50 audience members, and servers that have Tier 2 or Tier 3 Server Boosting can expand their capacity for using video in Stage channels to up to 150 or 300 viewers respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Read on to learn how to use video and screen sharing in Stage channels. <em>Spoiler: It’s just as easy as video chat is today.&nbsp;<br></em></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How to Share Your Video &amp; Screen in Stage Channels</strong></h2>\n            <p>The next time you hop on a Stage for your community, you’ll notice two new buttons you may be familiar with already: video and screen share. They function just like they do in the Voice channels and DM conversations you’re used to: use the video button to turn on your camera for your audience to see, or share your screen when it’s time for your community’s monthly joke-slideshow event.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/63ea51f518330d1ce697c16d_-6HO7YfrHkKOyTXP5mPl0C8iM0C66t7TBBU7tse0YUN-mkjTzQ_9PnMe0dd7T4QgGqxXcBhUgXEQhV8jGm8i1U5yKbthZmBuioDWnin-MCuYo5JD6ppgpRPnFLZUNW6WvaTpjZBGk86WG1FnYkaZgnE.png\" alt=\"A side-by-side example of an upgraded Stage experience on both mobile and desktop.&nbsp;\"></div>\n                <figcaption>Video, screen share and text chat for Stages can be enjoyed on both desktop and mobile.&nbsp;</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Stages are meant to share smaller, intimate conversations with a wider audience — this means there are some limitations to how many people can turn on their cameras or share their content.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Notably, <strong>up to five members can use video while on a Stage</strong> and <strong>one screen share is supported on a Stage channel at a time</strong>. The presenter sharing their screen can be different than the five others using video, and audience members won’t have their own audio or video feeds broadcast to the community without their permission — unless they willingly take to the Stage, of course.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Text chat in Stage channels works just like it does in Voice channels as well: select “Show Chat” on the top-right of the Stage and you’ll open up the Stage’s dedicated Text channel for conversation. And similar to how chat in Voice channels work today, Stage channels now have their own “Voice Chat Channel” Permission options section to let moderators run their conversations as they see fit.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1487pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/63ea51f4b43e376e1022346a_GjZ0sgKcmvwqvcIYEi7AzgJ6HvYbmWCT4UCyaxpOTlqSzkUB6XpRJD2ZLmWosXrNE33ZCVjhQvkIGM3wxVCy5QV8MRFaq375aZsoLCAMhfIEezC0V2axY82pRmbRtPpyfhsQjkFIC-fzKn_LhP5wzQ.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the “Video” Role permission in Server Settings.\"></div>\n                <figcaption>You can allow — or disallow — certain members from using Video or Screen Share by adjusting the “Video” permission in either Role or Channel permission settings.&nbsp;</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Now, let’s talk audience capacity on Stages that are using video. After all, all great concert halls only have so many seats available, and streaming video to dozens, or potentially hundreds at once, uses up a ton of robo-hamster wheel energy (sorry, Nelly).&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>To start, <strong>all Community servers that use video in Stage channels can hold up to 50 people</strong>, including both presenters and spectators, at once — that’s twice as much as today’s max viewer limit for using video chat in a standard Voice channel. (If you already use Voice channels to stream your favorite game to friends who aren’t currently talking over Voice, consider using a Stage next time!)</p>\n            <p>Want to use video or screen sharing in a Stage with more than 50 people? <strong>Utilize Server Boosting as a community or by yourself to increase your total capacity</strong>: Tier 2 boosted servers can host up to 150 people in a video Stage, and servers boosted all the way to Tier 3 can have up to 300 people total in a Stage that’s utilizing video! That’s a whole lotta friends watching you be the first person in the world to lick their elbow.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/63ea51f5154f9163b720b4a9__FuJ7cLxNX0yYNOGLcU5gdEz-_6Ue9lQs9BjKNa2ucFm42H-eGXI6j7BfLpVnUMRDiUnDuP8biZZpVS09pVADzmXMaLQJunULPs3ChvHg2gEt5bYc6MWUVhkhja8PT9nd90AJY7CEIe-vyCy3X_qqg.png\" alt=\"A demonstration of using video in a Stage channel.&nbsp;\"></div>\n                <figcaption>The Hydration Club’s annual water pouring competition. It’s a splash.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>We don’t always know our own strength, and your community is strongest when they come together. So what happens if more than 50, 150 or 300 people try to join the same Stage when someone’s using video?</p>\n            <p>It works pretty similarly to the existing 25-person limit on video calls in your Voice channels: if the video or screen share has already started, no more members will be allowed to join after 50 total people (or either 150 or 300 people for boosted servers).&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>For the full scoop on how video and screen share works in Stage channels, shine your light at <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722\">the Stage channels support article</a>.</p>\n            <p>Before your community heads to the limelight, there’s one extra lil’ feature we added: while your event’s stagehands are getting things ready for the show, the audience will now be serenaded by our loveliest waiting room music before the show starts. Or, you can turn it off by pressing the new “♫” button… ya’know, if you <em>really</em> want to…</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Your World is Watching, Literally: Video is Now in Stages</strong></h2>\n            <p>With the introduction of video, screen share and text chat support, Stage channels will help bring people together better than ever, no matter if you’re a proud performer using video on-stage or a more reserved audience member whose gained just a little extra confidence to peek out and say “hi” in text chat.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Remember: using Stage channels requires your server to be a Community Server. Don’t have “Community” enabled on your Discord server yet? It’s as simple as going into Server Settings and turning it on!

We recognize that safety enables people to find belonging, and that’s why safety is one of our most important investments and priorities.</p>\n            <p>Safety is a collaborative and cross-functional effort at Discord. Our Engineering, Data, and Product teams build products with safety principles in mind. Our Policy team takes a nuanced and sophisticated approach to developing our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> and forms strategic partnerships with academics, civil society, industry peers, and community moderators to advance our collective understanding of online safety. Our Safety team works with cutting-edge technology to detect and respond to abuse, both proactively and from reports received from users, moderators, and trusted third party reporters.</p>\n            <p>Safety is a vital priority for our company. Around 15% of all Discord employees are dedicated to this area and every employee shares in the commitment to keeping Discord safe.

We invest heavily in our proactive efforts to detect and remove abuse before it’s reported to us. Through advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized teams, and partnering with external experts, we work to remove high-harm abuse before it is viewed or experienced by others.<br><br>We encourage users, moderators, and trusted reporters to submit reports if they believe an account or server is violating our Community Guidelines. We analyze these reports to determine if the content or behavior violates our Guidelines. We may take a number of enforcement actions including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; temporarily or permanently disabling or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible; and potentially reporting them to law enforcement.</p>\n            <p>This report details the actions that Discord has taken on accounts and servers that have violated our Community Guidelines and <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a>.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Actions Taken on Accounts and Servers</strong></h2>\n            <h3><strong>Account and Server Warnings</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord issues warnings with the goal of preventing future violations of our Community Guidelines.

We deeply value our partnership with NCMEC and their efforts to ensure that grooming and endangerment cases are quickly escalated to law enforcement.</p>\n            <p>In the third quarter of 2022, we reported <strong>14,366 </strong>accounts to NCMEC. 14,303 of those reports were media (images or videos), of which many were flagged through PhotoDNA – a tool that uses a shared industry hash database of known CSAM. 63 high-harm grooming or endangerment reports were also delivered to NCMEC.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/639103f21adaaa03180244e5_rGRt-QLBjj1BV1Yvi0JstjyTAHhuhRN1gNOTrRhDy77vZwqKlJFCQZMkgIClaTRnckE0p23eKj3SWFb9zvS0UaYNvHIEckMbI7Uc7bgxF_yHvtc3gFJSdDPvXxJR4h0L8Fy16MvriYzn36peQwkjw1lHygGDMR3xUNgU_jTjTTJ3EJjHHWxPK-ihFmwoCg.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the reports filed to NCMEC chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-September-2022/blob/main/Q3%202022%20Transparency%20Report%20Data%20%20-%20NCMEC.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Discord disabled <strong>42,458 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>14,451 </strong>servers for Child Safety during the third quarter of 2022. This was a 92% decrease in the number of accounts disabled when compared to the previous quarter.</p>\n            <p>Our investment and prioritization in Child Safety has never been more robust. These decreases are the result of improvements in our efforts to detect and proactively remove child exploitative content from Discord. Specifically, better operating procedures and enhanced detection capabilities have enabled our team to identify these servers faster.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>By targeting and proactively removing networks of bad actors from Discord before they grew in size, fewer accounts participated in these spaces, and as a result, fewer accounts were disabled.</p>\n            <p>We were able to remove servers hosting CSAM content proactively <strong>99% </strong>of the time. Removing CSAM content is one of our top priorities, and we are proud of the cross-functional efforts that have enabled us to achieve this proactive takedown rate for CSAM.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Deceptive Practices</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of distributing malware, sharing or selling game hacks or cheats, theft of authentication tokens, or participating in identity, investment, and financial scams is a violation of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>8,800 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>2,137 </strong>servers for Deceptive Practices during the third quarter of 2022. This was an increase of 43% and 27% respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong>Exploitative and Unsolicited Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>It is a violation of our Community Guidelines to share or promote sexually explicit content of other people without their consent.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>47,570 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>1,837 </strong>servers<strong> </strong>for Exploitative and Unsolicited Content. This represents a 55% decrease in accounts disabled and a 21% decrease in servers removed when compared to the previous quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>This decrease was driven by our ability to identify and remove a specific abuse pattern, resulting in a decrease of servers created to host that content, and consequently, fewer accounts disabled for engaging with that content.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Harassment and Bullying</strong></h3>\n            <p>Harassment and bullying have no place on Discord. Continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments, circumventing bans, suggestive or overt threats, the sharing of someone’s personally identifiable information (also known as doxxing), and server raiding are violations of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>During the third quarter of 2022, <strong>11,347 </strong>accounts were disabled for harassment-related behavior, and <strong>555</strong> servers were removed for this issue.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Hateful Conduct</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord doesn’t allow the organization, promotion, or participation in hate speech or hateful conduct. We define “hate speech” as any form of expression that denigrates, vilifies, or dehumanizes; promotes intense, irrational feelings of enmity or hatred; or incites harm against people on the basis of protected characteristics. You can<a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/discord-policy-updates-2022\"> read our latest policy blog post</a> to learn more.</p>\n            <p>During the third quarter of 2022,<strong> 7,104 </strong>accounts and <strong>829</strong> servers were removed for hateful conduct. Compared to the previous quarter, this was an increase of 24% and 16%, respectively.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Identity and Authenticity</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of coordinating and participating in malicious impersonation of individuals or organizations is a violation of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>We disabled<strong> 3,561 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>13</strong> servers for this issue. This was a significant increase as we continue to improve our methods&nbsp; for detecting and removing malicious bots.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Misinformation</strong></h3>\n            <p>In February 2022, we published a blog post discussing our new policy prohibiting the sharing of false or misleading information on Discord that is likely to cause physical or societal harm. <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/addressing-health-misinformation\">This blog post</a> discusses the new policy and our enforcement criteria in more detail.</p>\n            <p>We disabled<strong> 385 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>52 </strong>servers for misinformation.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Platform Manipulation</strong></h3>\n            <p>Spam, fake accounts, and self-bots are examples of platform manipulation that damage the experience of our users and violate our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>During the third quarter of 2022, <strong>1,197 </strong>accounts and <strong>656</strong> servers were removed for platform manipulation-related issues not related to spam. An additional <strong>50,510,769 </strong>accounts were disabled for spam or spam-related offenses.</p>\n            <p>We're focused on combating spam and minimizing users’ exposure to spammers and spam content on Discord. We have a dedicated cross-functional anti-spam team building sophisticated anti-spam measures, and as a result of this work, 90% of accounts disabled for spam were disabled proactively, before we received any user report.</p>\n            <p>You can read more about how Discord fights spam <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-is-fighting-spam\">here</a>. You can also read <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/new-anti-spam-raid-automod-safety-update\">this blog post</a> published in September about Automod, a new safety feature that enables server owners to automatically moderate certain abuse, including spam.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Regulated or Illegal Activities</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of engaging in regulated, illegal, or dangerous activities is strictly prohibited, including selling or facilitating the sale of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods or services.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>37,284 </strong>accounts for engaging in this behavior, an increase of 35.5% from the prior quarter. A total of <strong>6,950 </strong>servers were removed for this category with a proactive removal rate of 63%.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong>Self-Harm Concerns</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstance. We recently expanded our Self Harm Encouragement and Promotion Policy which you can read more about <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20allow%20any,help%20for%20self%2Dharm%20behaviors\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Actions may be taken on accounts or servers encouraging people to cut themselves or embrace eating disorders, or otherwise manipulating and coercing other users to engage in acts of self-harm. These actions are only taken on accounts glorifying or promoting acts of self-harm, not on users seeking help or in need of medical attention.</p>\n            <p>In September we announced a new partnership with <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org\">Crisis Text Line</a>, a nonprofit that provides 24/7 text-based mental health support and crisis intervention via trained volunteer crisis counselors. Crisis Text Line is currently available to those in the United States and is offered in both English and Spanish. You can read more about this partnership <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work\">here</a>.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>1,297 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>610 </strong>servers for Self-Harm concerns.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent and Graphic Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>Real media depicting gore, excessive violence, the glorification of violence, or animal cruelty with the intent to harass or shock others is not allowed on Discord.</p>\n            <p>In the third quarter of 2022, <strong>12,300 </strong>accounts<strong> </strong>were disabled for posting violent and graphic content. We also removed <strong>1,313 </strong>servers<strong> </strong>for violent and graphic content.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent Extremism</strong></h3>\n            <p>We consider violent extremism to be the support, encouragement, promotion, or organization of violent acts or ideologies that advocate for the destruction of society, often by blaming certain individuals or groups and calling for violence against them.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord\">This blog post</a> discusses our methods to address violent extremism. Through partnering and engaging in cross-industry work with Tech Against Terrorism, the Global Internet Forum To Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), the European Union Internet Forum, and other organizations, we’ve made progress in our tooling, policy, and subject matter expertise to ensure that violent extremism does not have a home on Discord.</p>\n            <p>In the third quarter of 2022, <strong>12,489 </strong>accounts and <strong>1,053 </strong>servers were removed for violent extremism.<br>‍</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Information Requests</strong></h2>\n            <p>When appropriate, Discord complies with information requests from law enforcement agencies while respecting the privacy and rights of our users.</p>\n            <p>Law enforcement must provide valid legal documentation for the requested information. We review each information request to ensure legal compliance.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Discord may also disclose user data to law enforcement in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is an imminent risk of serious physical injury or death.

We work to limit disclosures of user information and content so they match the specific circumstances dictated by each request.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1400px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/639b6f6ae58842e1dc86608f_-aWfDJ4797I_UJxirf4TqONA3ozBfkuT4-ObKVruIrK88yx16rA1RMshkBpqs0nFkyqQQu0S1diuwuDQo6QWBnRBEkrusSaDPjLlG8gRNCyXqqLjB6BlhwNc61uo3ySidw2ulve8E5lYzJYZlTs3Hw77xtUBA6QAaNT87fina4ZcNaUoia8InwbA0FMYhw.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the requests from law enforcement chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-September-2022/blob/main/Q3%202022%20Transparency%20Report%20Data%20%20-%20Legal.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <h3><strong>Emergency Requests</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord received <strong>213 </strong>emergency disclosure requests from law enforcement during this period.

It’s like being a loving father with dozens of pictures of his family shoved inside his wallet, but instead of photos of extended family, it’s all you and your dozens of strangely-popular meme video Twitter accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Last October, we told you we were working on <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/building-the-future-of-discord\">evolving Connections</a> with a brand-new experience. Starting today, we’re excited to share that we’re giving Connections a <em>huge</em> functionality boost for Discord users and developers with <strong>Linked Roles</strong>: a new type of role that’s created by authenticating your profile with an account outside of Discord.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Over twenty official Connections are rolling out with new functionality across the next few weeks, from categories such as gaming, social, marketplaces, fitness, finance, and art. You can connect a multitude of your passions and interests to your Discord profile including eBay, PayPal, Crunchyroll, Epic Games Store, Twitter, Reddit, Steam, Jefit, DeviantArt, Bloxlink, and plenty more.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>You’ll be able to show off (or not show off if you prefer) all these official Connections directly on your profile and even certain details from certain connected accounts, such as follower count and site activity. These Connections can then be utilized by community moderators and admins to build or grant new <strong>Linked Roles</strong> that can provide access to special channels and added safety within their server.</p>\n            <p>Check out the following image to take a peek at the official Connection offerings, all upgraded to support Linked Roles:&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:972px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6397629681d7b149390c2f08_Add_Connection_Modal_NEW.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The menu to add a Connection to your Discord profile.

These updates will make it even easier for you to build trust in the interactions you’re having so you can feel confident that the person you’re chatting with is the real deal: a DeviantArt artist you’re commissioning, a highly-rated eBay seller, a Redditor in your DMs, your Jefit workout buddy, a legit Dota 2 player verified by Steam, the right Destiny raid group via Charlemagne, your favorite Robloxian verified by Bloxlink, and tons more.&nbsp;</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-iframe\">\n                <center><iframe width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IxQvRvNyD4\" title=\"Access more places with Connections &amp; Linked Roles\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></center>\n            </div>\n            <p>In addition, people across hundreds of communities already sell or trade things regularly on Discord. Buffing up Connections helps reduce the chance of falling for scams and false identities — you’ll know that the channel you’ve just joined is full of like-minded folks who also linked an external account or payment method like PayPal so you can feel more confident in their legitimacy.<br>‍<br></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Connect Accounts to Gain Linked Roles</strong></h2>\n            <p>Let’s get the basics down first: A <em>Connection</em> is a way to display account information on your Discord by linking to it. You link your accounts by signing into them, verifying that you own them in the process. This makes connected accounts way more trustworthy than a text field and you can also choose to display any of these Connections on your profile.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width:\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/63867abf9ff40f6c0beb9cf6__kYGV7J1a0ivgpXH5SGT2ZLdd2kChM6MIv35Clf_DTOpfLJLGoKk55x-6SLIpyGDd_el5otQdNNc8LcFxmkrati27u_5ld3rix7swoMZtDUTUqiODNYIlnS6rWOA1hgghot2Ppj4-MAMJkoLSU3YVdvb5DOhwXZDLyJ04TxYTl-Rhroq0FkMqMlE1rnu.png\" alt=\"A Discord profile for a user named “Phibi.” They have Steam, Reddit, PayPal, and Twitter, Spotify and YouTube accounts displayed on their profile.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>We wanted to take authentication a step further by allowing these external identities to share extra info from your Connections. Now, in addition to signing in to an account to prove you own it, <strong>certain Connections will now provide additional details and stats</strong>, such as how many followers an account may have or if you’re a highly-reviewed seller, to further legitimize the person behind the Discord account.</p>\n            <p><strong>Admins and moderators won’t get to utilize your info automatically</strong>: Even if you connect some accounts to your Discord profile before joining a server, <strong>you’ll need to manually opt-in to any Linked Roles to make use of the information from your connected accounts</strong>. This helps protect your privacy in every new server you join!</p>\n            <p>You even can obtain a Linked Role for a community without displaying Connection details on your personal profile — the Connection information is checked without the community admins ever seeing it. <strong>If a server you’re in offers a Linked Role, you’ll find a new Linked Roles option in your Server Settings drop-down menu.</strong></p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:640pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6393aa677653c47e96c134b9_pZfkxSnGv-L7GPZzOZKg3bySTeU2loU4X1CXRCGSTE56ygi3_FiNoJ7g2nZbGPSY6KzDKhjk1_nHt3Okc3DbnBXAVxrTi-Hz00RIgi4c05uL_Ha2yUNJ_lHbYHuwJBo-bjYqRTnZAcjpfDDL1ZsEiQyoiNgiU8JICy7iZqVNALTcopGbHtlURBKbffsLfg.gif\" alt=\"An animated gif showing a step-by-step demonstration of how a user receives a Linked Role.&nbsp;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Once you select the new Linked Roles option, you can select the role (or roles) you’re interested in obtaining to gain access to private spaces or special perks within that server.

Happen to already have connected the necessary accounts in the past?

With over 75% of Discord users living outside the U.S., these icons have become vital for communication on Discord 🔑:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Users across the globe share on average over 4.3 billion emojis each week with their Discord communities.</li>\n                <li>Since Discord first launched in 2015, people have sent over 291 billion emojis and reacted to messages with 145 billion emojis.</li>\n                <li>In the past 365 days alone, an average of over 455,000 emojis were used on Discord <em>every minute</em><strong> </strong>– that’s over 7,600 emojis used every second!</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>To further understand the magic behind emojis – both on and off Discord – we surveyed 16,000 people around the world 🌎 to understand why they’re beloved by so many.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>What did we learn?</strong> 🤔💡</p>\n            <p>Emojis are essential to ensuring good, effective communication, particularly among Gen Z. These tiny pictures are worth thousands of words – they help people feel accepted and understood by others, and allow self-expression in a way text just can’t convey. Emojis also connect people and communities globally, boost self-confidence, and cultivate friendships. 👫</p>\n            <p>But don’t take our word for it!

Through advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized teams, and partnering with external experts, we work to remove high-harm abuse before it is viewed or experienced by others.<br><br>We encourage users, moderators, and trusted reporters to submit reports if they believe an account or server is violating our Community Guidelines.

Child-harm content is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord or the internet at large. We work with industry peers, civil society, and law enforcement to ensure that this effort extends beyond Discord. Discord is an active supporter of cross-industry programs such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and is a member of the Technology Coalition. We’re also a frequent sponsor of events dedicated to increasing awareness of and action on child safety issues such as the annual Dallas Crime Against Children Convention.</p>\n            <p>We have a dedicated team and invest heavily in advanced tooling and <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044154611-Talking-about-online-safety-with-your-teen\">education</a> so parents know how our service works and understand the controls that can contribute to creating a positive and safe experience on Discord for their children. As part of our ongoing commitment to parent engagement, Discord is a proud sponsor of the National Parent Teacher Association and ConnectSafely. We continue to be a member of the Family Online Safety Institute, contributing to and learning from its important work.</p>\n            <p>Discord disabled <strong>532,498 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>15,163 </strong>servers for Child Safety in the second quarter of 2022. Servers removed for CSAM increased to <strong>6,640, </strong>up from 1,271, with a proactive removal rate of 95%. This is a significant increase from the 52% CSAM server proactive removal rate in the first quarter of 2022, and resulted from the introduction of new tools built to identify and detect servers hosting this content.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Users who upload abuse material of minors to Discord are reported to NCMEC and removed from the service. We deeply value our partnership with NCMEC and their efforts to ensure that grooming and endangerment cases are quickly escalated to law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In the second quarter of 2022, we reported <strong>21,529 </strong>accounts to NCMEC, a 101% increase in reports made when compared to the first quarter of 2022. 21,425 of those reports were media (images or videos), of which many were flagged through PhotoDNA – a tool that uses a shared industry hash database of known CSAM. 104 high-harm grooming or endangerment reports were also delivered to NCMEC.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6359bc5d4e00544ad04401b2_ORdPtBRebT5Wahdsyy1x2oZ_uHP3ZK8bxoofxGOJ4ZSpgLkOf5lBmtKi8TytcIYGpP7-yy9rLMSyTDQethbe1avkJaXC7XX8Tb621w4zVBVUw1d8IaU2aRJWtEYKeRBX3zM7e1UflNOoZs4EVU3suhabJmNyREYClg2PIxyxwDzliPBuw0zNN-gFRg.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the reports filed to NCMEC chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-April-June-2022/blob/main/Q2%202022%20Transparency%20Data%20-%20Q2%20NCMEC%20Reports.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Of the 532,498<strong> </strong>accounts and 15,163<strong> </strong>servers removed for Child Safety, <strong>497,267 </strong>accounts and <strong>7,834 </strong>servers were removed for Sexualized Content Regarding Minors (SCRM), the largest sub-category within Child Safety. This represents a 30% decrease in accounts disabled and a 65% decrease in servers removed for SCRM from the previous quarter.</p>\n            <p>These decreases can be attributed to better operating procedures and our enhanced detection capabilities which enable our team to identify these servers faster. We believe these interventions have resulted in a behavioral shift with fewer SCRM servers created and fewer accounts joining these servers when they are created.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Deceptive Practices</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of distributing malware, sharing or selling game hacks or cheats, and theft of authentication tokens is a violation of our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>6,150 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>1,677 </strong>servers for Deceptive Practices during the second quarter of 2022.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Exploitative and Unsolicited Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>It is a violation of our Community Guidelines to share or promote sexually explicit content of other people without their consent.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>106,645* </strong>accounts and removed <strong>2,326 </strong>servers<strong> </strong>for Exploitative and Unsolicited Content, which remained the second-largest category of accounts disabled. Accounts disabled for this category declined by 27.5% when compared to the previous quarter. This decline was largely the result of successfully targeting specific abuse types<strong> </strong>that comprised the higher number of actionable content during the first quarter.</p>\n            <p>For nonconsensual pornography, one of the high-harm issues that Discord targets proactively, <strong>701</strong> servers were removed, with a proactive removal rate of 36%.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong>Harassment and Bullying</strong></h3>\n            <p>Harassment and bullying have no place on Discord. Continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments, circumventing bans, suggestive or overt threats, the sharing of someone’s personally identifiable information (also known as doxxing), and server raiding are violations of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>During the second quarter of 2022, <strong>13,779 </strong>accounts were disabled for harassment-related behavior, and <strong>598</strong> servers were removed for this issue.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Hateful Conduct</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord doesn’t allow the organization, promotion, or participation in hate speech or hateful conduct.</p>\n            <p>During the second quarter of 2022,<strong> 5,719 </strong>accounts and <strong>713</strong> servers were removed for hateful conduct. Compared to the previous quarter, this was a decrease of 35% and 25%, respectively.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Identity and Authenticity</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of coordinating and participating in malicious impersonation of individuals or organizations is a violation of our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We disabled<strong> 148 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>12</strong> servers for this issue.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Misinformation</strong></h3>\n            <p>We recently published a blog post discussing our new policy prohibiting the sharing of false or misleading information on Discord that is likely to cause physical or societal harm. <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/addressing-health-misinformation\">This blog post</a> discusses the new policy and our enforcement criteria in more detail.</p>\n            <p>We disabled<strong> 270 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>73 </strong>servers for misinformation.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Platform Manipulation</strong></h3>\n            <p>Spam, fake accounts, and self-bots are examples of platform manipulation that damage the experience of our users and violate our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>During the second quarter of 2022, <strong>3,400 </strong>accounts and <strong>351</strong> servers were removed for platform manipulation-related issues not related to spam. An additional <strong>27,733,948 </strong>accounts were disabled for spam or spam-related offenses.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We're focused on combating spam and minimizing users’ exposure to spammers and spam content on Discord. We have a dedicated cross-functional anti-spam team building sophisticated anti-spam measures, and as a result of this work, 90% of accounts disabled for spam were disabled proactively, before we received any user report.</p>\n            <p>You can read more about how Discord fights spam <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-is-fighting-spam\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong>Regulated or Illegal Activities</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of engaging in regulated, illegal, or dangerous activities is strictly prohibited, including selling or facilitating the sale of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods or services.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>27,494 </strong>accounts for engaging in this behavior, an increase of 39.5% from the prior quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>A total of <strong>4,639 </strong>servers were removed for this category with a proactive removal rate of 60.5%. The overall increase in warnings, accounts disabled, and servers removed for this category was the result of more sophisticated methods for proactive detection being introduced during the quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong>Self-Harm Concerns</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstance.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Actions may be taken on accounts or servers encouraging people to cut themselves or embrace eating disorders, or otherwise manipulating and coercing other users to engage in acts of self-harm. These actions are only taken on accounts glorifying or promoting acts of self-harm, not on users seeking help or in need of medical attention.</p>\n            <p>We recently announced a new partnership with <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org\">Crisis Text Line</a>, a nonprofit that provides 24/7 text-based mental health support and crisis intervention via trained volunteer crisis counselors. Crisis Text Line is currently available to those in the United States and is offered in both English and Spanish. You can read more about this partnership <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/an-update-on-our-mental-health-belonging-work\">here</a>.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>2,495 </strong>accounts and removed <strong>620 </strong>servers for self-harm concerns.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent and Graphic Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>Real media depicting gore, excessive violence, the glorification of violence, or animal cruelty with the intent to harass or shock others is not allowed on Discord.</p>\n            <p>In the second quarter of 2022, <strong>15,630 </strong>accounts<strong> </strong>were disabled for posting violent and graphic content. We also removed <strong>1,286 </strong>servers<strong> </strong>for violent and graphic content.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent Extremism</strong></h3>\n            <p>We consider violent extremism to be the support, encouragement, promotion, or organization of violent acts or ideologies that advocate for the destruction of society, often by blaming certain individuals or groups and calling for violence against them.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord\">This blog post</a> discusses our methods to address violent extremism. Through partnering and engaging in cross-industry work with Tech Against Terrorism, the Global Internet Forum To Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), the European Union Internet Forum and other organizations, we’ve made progress in our tooling, policy, and subject matter expertise to ensure that violent extremism does not have a home on Discord.</p>\n            <p>We want to acknowledge the horrific attack in Buffalo, New York that occurred on May 14, 2022.

We review each information request to ensure legal compliance.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Discord may also disclose user data to law enforcement in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is an imminent risk of serious physical injury or death.

Here’s a short guide to help you turn from a rookie to an app pro, just like the millions of users who interact with Discord apps every day!<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>Who builds these apps?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>You do! Or you might know one of the thousands of talented, creative, and hard-working Discord users around the world who make apps! Our Discord Developer community has been a place for programmers of all skill levels to meet each other, experiment and iterate together, and grow their skills.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>How do I find Discord apps?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>There are a handful of easy ways to discover apps. The newest way (and most exciting!) is to head to the App Directory, which you can find in <strong>Server Settings &gt; App Directory</strong> if you’re a moderator or admin, or visit the <a href=\"https://discord.com/application-directory\">App Directory here</a>.</p>\n            <p>‍</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/634dddde3cec1a8b5f1501e0_bxkOu1qrC8VT-XsR3DE8dYSu836kHXOTAz-oDscyWC4EXArV0kQu-JqNdVl6mRnP1gYRZQuBoF0wA9emouuz6WkrRFJ2e-GOqzou7lbvaD0Tvh1vDzK93RolIPB9knEQlvNmqTKcGiHRBTJ_20oxuUsBXtain4O4RIy3qTTrhpwYVVwj1M9oZZDh4g.png\" alt=\"An illustration of laptop that has the new App Directory opened on Discord.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>‍</p>\n            <p>You can also type a slash (“/”) in your chat input to bring up a list of app commands available in the server already: the app icons are listed vertically on the left. Last but not least, you might be in a server that already has some apps installed. Check the server’s member list for names with a “Bot” tag — that’s an app!</p>\n            <h2><strong>How do I use apps?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>All you need to do is type a slash (“/”) in the chat input bar to see a list pop-up of all the available Slash Commands in the server. If you’re in a server that already has apps, usually there are already tons of people already interacting with it — ask your servermates what the Slash Commands do, or watch a friend use them if you’re too shy to try ‘em yourself.<br><br></p>\n            <h2><strong>How do I add Discord apps to my server?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>First, you must have the “Manage Server” permission on you or your role in order to add apps to a server. If you have the necessary permissions, you can access the App Directory in Server Settings.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>You can also use the “Add to Server” button from an app’s profile. After using either the App Directory or Add to Server button, you’ll see a dropdown list of available servers you have permission to add the app to. You’ll be asked to accept the app’s necessary permissions first (every app is different!), and then you’re good to go.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/634de6d26920b35e8febbc6c_55ChVCVEBpp9fW67rpL9u3oPjAvnoVDSk_QNtufIzIBhHVAG7LfsO84FDMixXkNDMJWcqR5YrHvkk40e7UAx2JywgO7t5sHJfdPceyWvTf09Mu-SkD4JqCxpfsrLD2WhXWHjicaOUyiLAAZnJrskJDBUTcmflwNw7NdWyl_LbKZf0VDCw963u74fuQ.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>How do I know what info the app will be able to access when I add it to my server?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>See that image above of the necessary permissions? When you go to add an app to your server, it will display a list of what info the app will be able to access if you continue. This is usually things like accessing your username (just the name, not your whole account!), or knowing what servers you’re in (so it knows where to go!).&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Anything listed here is required for the app to do its magic, and every app has different requirements. After you say you’re okay with what it needs, you’ll see a list of checkboxes for permissions you want to give the app - just like you would with a user - like sending messages (so you can talk to it), managing nicknames, moderating members, or managing emoji and stickers.</p>\n            <p>You can learn more about what sorts of data apps can utilize <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access\">over here</a>.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>How do I learn how to use a specific app?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>Some developers include a command in their apps designed to help you out, such as /about or /help. You can also visit the app’s official server on Discord listed on the app’s page on the App Directory.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Sometimes their server is just for support, while others are for fans of the app where they can try the latest iterations that the developer is releasing and meet others in the app’s fan community.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>As described in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a>, the developer of an app is responsible for the app and you should review any terms and policies provided by the developer that apply to its use.<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>Can I customize the app for myself or my server?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>Many apps offer customizations, like adding your own questions to a trivia app or having more detailed stats. Sometimes these are part of their own premium app subscription offerings, which you can learn about in the next question, which is…<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>How do I support the developer of an app I like?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n            <p>Spread the word! Tell others about the app, add it to more of your servers so more people can see it, and spread the love! Some developers may seek out feedback on their app, so join their official server via the app’s Directory page and see if there are opportunities to help ‘em out.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>And soon, you’ll soon be able to help keep them in business by supporting them financially! We’re currently testing out Premium App subscriptions, which means you can subscribe to an app you love directly within Discord they have a premium offering.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>You’ll be able to do this in the App Directory, on your Integrations page in Server Settings, or in the app’s user profile. After you’ve subscribed, you can manage this subscription in User Settings &gt; Subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><em>Note: At the time of publication, Premium App subscriptions are in a closed alpha phase.

We were frustrated with the options that were out there — they were limiting and didn’t work well for creating the shared experiences we wanted. So it was really important for us to build a platform that was not only incredibly reliable, but flexible for all the ways people wanted to use Discord back then and in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Seven years later, we are humbled to see that Discord has become so much more than we could have imagined. And it means something different to everyone: a place to hang out with your people, a space to share experiences with your community, and more recently, an opportunity for creators and developers to build sustainable businesses.</p>\n            <p>We know from all of you that having the ability to customize and enhance Discord has never been more important. Millions of people are using Nitro subscriptions to supercharge their Discord. Meanwhile, a vibrant ecosystem of apps has emerged. Over 30% of active servers rely on apps for customizations, playing fun games, and keeping conversations safe. And we’ve seen billions of app commands used on Discord so far this year, which have doubled compared to this time last year.</p>\n            <p>As we look to the future and how we can continue to make Discord more helpful and useful, we’re cooking up all kinds of things to make it easier for developers, admins, communities, and all users to enhance and customize our platform. That’s what our news today is all about: from new Nitro offerings to opening up our platform to invite developers to help us dream up the future of Discord.</p>\n            <p>This week, we unlock a new world of possibilities with:&nbsp;</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>A way for admins to browse a database of apps natively through an all new <a href=\"https://discord.com/application-directory\"><strong>App Directory</strong></a> and add them to their servers<strong>.</strong></li>\n                <li><strong>Activities</strong>, a new feature that brings fun group experiences like playing games and watching videos into Voice Channels.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>Resources for developers including <strong>Premium App Subscriptions</strong> to enable them to earn money<strong> </strong>and our first-ever <strong>Ecosystem Fund </strong>for developers, start-ups, and partners to bring their creativity to Discord.</li>\n                <li>A new entry-level tier of our subscription plan, <strong>Nitro Basic</strong>, priced at $2.99 USD per month.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>And sneak peek! Next month, we’re making <strong>Connections </strong>even better and more useful by rolling out a brand new experience with Verified Roles for Connections like PayPal, and welcoming third parties to help us build for the future.</p>\n            <p>Now that you have a quick preview, let’s get right to these awesome updates!</p>\n            <h2><strong>Customize Community Spaces With the New App Directory</strong></h2>\n            <p>Apps are a fundamental part of our platform. <em>What are apps? </em>They are games and game-masters, facilitators and schedulers, bouncers and guardians, friends and someone to talk to. They can even turn your server into a place that rewards the activity you love seeing the most from your community, like leveling-up users for talking to new friends. When you add an app to your server, you can type a slash \"/\" to interact with it and tell it how to help you. They're usually in the member list too, and you can see information about them in their profile. Over 500,000 apps are used on Discord to help with things like server customization, playing games, and keeping communities safe. But they haven’t always been easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>That’s why starting tomorrow, we’re rolling out the ability to tap into a thriving ecosystem of inventive apps through our <a href=\"https://discord.com/application-directory\"><strong>App Directory</strong></a>. You might remember that we <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/discord-bots-and-app-discovery-announcement\">teased this work</a> last year. So we’re excited to tell you that admins will finally have the ability to browse a database of apps and add whichever ones they choose to any server they manage on Discord — without relying on third-party websites or search engines.</p>\n            <p>Through App Directory, you’ll be able to easily customize your community with third-party apps and discover your new favorites through curated app collections.</p>\n            <p>Not sure where to start? Check out the new <em>StockX DropBot</em> for every drop in current culture.&nbsp; From sneakers and apparel to collectibles and electronics, you’ll be able to keep up with the latest releases, tap in with other collectors, score some heat with giveaways, and even test your industry knowledge with trivia challenges! Need suggestions on what to watch for movie night? Head over to the <em>Hey, Netflix</em> app to discover new shows and movies to watch and discuss together, across borders and without spoilers!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Support Your Favorite Apps through Premium App Subscriptions</strong>‍</h2>\n            <p>The world of apps is a big part of Discord, and we want our platform to be a place where developers can explore their creativity, and that includes app developers who want to earn money.<br><br>So we’re experimenting with Premium App Subscriptions and enabling a small group of developers to sell premium features of their apps natively on Discord. Running in tandem with the App Directory launch, users can begin subscribing to premium features of apps that have integrated this feature. While this is a closed experiment for now, interested developers can sign up <a href=\"http://discord.com/build\">here</a> to learn more as we roll this out further.&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Hang Out Together Through Activities&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n            <p>Shared experiences are at the heart of Discord. Last year, we conducted user research to better understand how users enjoy spending their time on Discord. While 85% of the users surveyed said they played games with friends over Discord on a regular basis, their primary purpose for playing was actually to bond with friends. So we put this insight to the test and built a few simple, easy-to-join Activities that enabled people to connect, laugh, and bond together on Discord.&nbsp; <br></p>\n            <p>Today, we’re hyped to begin the rollout of <strong>Activities </strong>— a way for users to hang out online in more interactive ways, such as playing games or watching videos together (read: cute capybara videos) directly within Discord. <br></p>\n            <p>Look for the new Rocket Ship 🚀 button in your Voice Channel to access tons of new ways to spend time with your friends and communities. Starting this week, everyone will have access to begin two activities: Putt Party and Watch Together. Discord Nitro subscribers can launch even more activities including Poker Night, Sketch Heads, Chess, Land-io, Letter League and more. Once launched, they can invite their friends who don’t have Discord Nitro to join their expanded selection of Activities. It’s like being the cool friend who always brings over the best board games!</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6349cdf1991de577dfe3aff4_EFh7bQqLMEGdyv-PVSqjn88lb7zlA9gqlezjrl8s0G25UKFFgr6uuq90-MlJ7y4tFy1LSTv4_iQ_EfMgijCPjSt8tseIftlWD7PxtlMdhjuz5Zzu_7AQv6CYsqEHjKsG-RNP8LpsdiJnO9o3iTHlG0eRt1EdVq7Ua2y1Z7HLXg9QeIcUZvar5IqV.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>We’ve heard from developers that they want to bring their creativity to even more areas of Discord, beyond chat.

While we want Discord to be everyone’s home away from home, fostering a trusted, safe environment is of paramount importance and central to the notion of community.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>You may have seen that we introduced <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/automod-launch-automatic-community-moderation\">AutoMod</a> in June and since launch it’s already automatically removed <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/new-anti-spam-raid-automod-safety-update\">20 million</a> unwanted messages from servers before they even had a chance to be posted.</p>\n            <p>While we’re excited to see this kind of progress, we know that work in this space is ever-growing. That’s why we’re now evolving <strong>Connections</strong> and will be rolling out a brand new experience with <strong>Verified Roles</strong> starting next month. This feature serves as a crucial tool for our communities to build trust in their interactions taking place in their servers.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>There’s a good chance you already use Connections to show your friends what console game you’re playing or what music you’re listening to. Through this new experience, you’ll be able to connect several new external identities to show who you are, share more about yourself on your profile, and access new experiences based on your credentials. Admins will be able to grant a new type of role (Verified Roles!) in their servers, based on what Connections users have. And we’re inviting developers to <a href=\"http://discord.com/build\">reach out</a> to learn more about creating the next set of Connections available with us!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Funding Developers and Start-ups</strong></h2>\n            <p>On top of all the cool new products announced today for developers, we’re starting with $5 million dollars of committed funding for prospective developers, early-stage start-ups, and strategic partners to bring their creativity to Discord.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Tap Into Some of the Most-Loved Nitro Features with Nitro Basic</strong></h2>\n            <p>And finally, we’re coming at you with more exciting news and possibilities to elevate your experience … introducing the latest addition to our Nitro Family: <strong>Nitro Basic</strong>!&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6349cdf1847f49717bb127cd_Dg17D-zCvF_SSwlYrayky0z3nBzjbAOcC6n3CAl8G8Kpn0DKd_oLEvhKm0op5QO8Mq_QB1qcOy8D-IlNXWThOhe7OwIAsSLccl9YvMTdVU6lNrbWzzVFwyMA6AgIuWifZwLvwa0e1ZdTij--TXEmLIhDrDdscRUCz3e227qcrp7UXzahy9NyRire.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Nitro is our subscription offering that gives you more ways to supercharge your experience on Discord. <strong>Nitro Basic</strong> is the newest addition to the Nitro lineup, serving as a new entry tier that unlocks more fun — only $2.99 per month, including:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Animated and custom emojis anywhere:</strong> Freely use custom-made emojis from any server you belong to, and use them anywhere you can use emojis.</li>\n                <li><strong>Bigger file uploads: </strong>Upload photos, videos and any other files up to 50MB.</li>\n                <li><strong>Special Nitro profile badge:</strong> Get a snazzy profile badge to show your support.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For our friends across the pond in the United Kingdom, you might have seen Nitro Basic as a new option earlier this summer.

Supporting people on their journey to find belonging is of utmost importance to us, and our community admins, moderators and creators are at the forefront of making it all happen.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Moderators and creators play a unique role within their servers: one that comes with greater responsibility and results in a more unique and potentially stressful experience than their community members. In honor of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day/2022\">World Mental Health day,</a> we’re proud to be partnering with <a href=\"https://twloha.com/\">To Write Love On Her Arms</a> to open the door for important conversation about burnout and help provide tools tailored to these leaders.</p>\n            <p>Burnout is a responsibility-related stress: a state of physical or emotional exhaustion that can involve a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal identity.</p>\n            <p>Burnout can take different forms within everyone, which can make it hard to pinpoint. TWLOHA created a <a href=\"https://twloha.com/self-care/\">guide</a> that can help moderators and creators with self-care. Along with this guide, they can <a href=\"https://twloha.com/find-help/help-by-topic/depression-anxiety/\">find self-care support </a>and <a href=\"https://twloha.com/find-help/24-hour-helplines/\">additional mental health resources</a> based on their individual needs.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>To continue the conversation, TWLOHA and Discord are hosting a roundtable discussion where fellow creators<strong> </strong>will sit down together and get real about their experiences with burnout.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>You can RSVP to attend the Stage channel event on October 19th at 1pm PST in the Creator Haven server, which you can join by clicking right<a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1Cx4B5aM9Sny53Th-pzww6w2bach\"> here</a>. </p>\n            <p>We hope you have a relaxing, stress-free World Mental Health Day.

Since <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/automod-launch-automatic-community-moderation\">the introduction of AutoMod and its keyword filtering abilities back in June</a>, over 20 million unwanted messages have been automatically removed from servers<strong> </strong>before they had a chance to be posted. </p>\n            <p>You read that right: <strong>AutoMod has removed over 20 million unwanted messages since its inception</strong>. If it took an average of five-ish seconds to review and decide to delete a message on your own, it would equate to about 1157 days saved — 1157 days that are better spent connecting with friends, building communities, and collectively committing culinary atrocities in #questionable-foods. We couldn’t be more excited to give that time back to you. </p>\n            <p>But we’re not stopping there: Today we're introducing new features and sharing a sneak peek into our plans that'll make it easier to keep your communities safer from two big evils: spam and raids.<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>AutoMod Blocks Spammy Messages Before They’re Posted</strong></h2>\n            <p>AutoMod now comes equipped with spam-cleansing abilities that help you identify and block messages containing spammy text content and excessive mentions across all of your text channels, Threads, Text Chat in Voice, and yep — even our <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/forum-channels-space-for-organized-conversation\">recently released Forum channels</a>.</p>\n            <p>Whether you've seen them out in the wild or you’ve already prepared yourself by reading our <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/common-scams-what-to-look-out-for\">Scams and What to Look Out For</a> post, you’ve likely come across ‘em before: shady links made to look like legit websites. “You won’t believe how easy it is to get some free Discord Nitro at ‘fre3-nitr0-leg1t.com,” they say — that’s because it’s completely fake.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1480pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/632a1fd137dad7bc61afb20a_ks_eLzvHDgB23cNs7IzW85vykaaM7mW3XZFHryyJ6dbT7vXC56l1yJRUaxxrSEEhGtdiFaGCIszbyJnOTMGwmEYWq5bOPpKFrvAkpSy5yT1X8Om5NGEZJ2nG9rCkeCK9rzMWU4rD2kDnmdJEGFrFQiA5VMcMibi55MuMLmvsSWnU7sbLOwTF1nc0bg.png\" alt=\"A screencapture of the settings for AutoMod’s new “Block Spam Content” filter.‍\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>With AutoMod's <strong>\"Block Spam Content\" filter</strong>, you'll be able to identify users who try to post messages and links that have been widely-reported as spam on Discord and block them before they’re posted.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Alongside general content spam, there’s another type of spam that *really* gets people’s attention: a cavalcade of bloopbloopbloopbloopbloop notifications that throws off your groove, forcing you to deal with someone who decided to mention every individual in your community.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In addition to blocking content spam, <strong>AutoMod can also “Block Mention Spam” for you</strong>. Any message that mentions an excessive number of members will be blocked, saving your community from getting those annoying bleepbloops in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1480pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/632a39a5e1ca69327f4f1bd1_Grjk3KZJB726JWPLXjC7QYfD4DWP6JHgdkgI1C75qsymbMnAcwc7GUOUjOaVQ6G6uJNSleSEf7cWqsmmk8we80nEquo4wVQH7ArlznSZQTdg4OPHYOcEI-CBMnhPvElox3SLmgbXIa886J-5cwiIyoBLyHj1CdBnL_YVg6qOKnRm3APO1SyWLhFWsg.png\" alt=\"A screencapture of the settings for AutoMod’s new “Block Mention Spam” filter.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Both “Block Mention Spam” and “Block Spam Content” can be found in <strong>Server Settings &gt; AutoMod</strong>, as long as <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server\">Community is enabled</a>.

This open-arm mentality can sometimes carry a bit more weight than expected — some baddies may get a hold of your server’s invite and what follows is a plethora of suspiciously-similar accounts named “NotARobot” all barging in at once. </p>\n            <p>We’re focused on building tools to help better detect and prevent raids in your communities, while making it easier to de-escalate them should they happen. We’re early in our progress on anti-raid capabilities, but we’d like to introduce a few features your community can use now: <br><br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Pause Invites Without Fully Deleting Them</strong></h2>\n            <p>To help manage and control surges in new members, <strong>you and your moderation team now have the ability to pause your server’s invites</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1536pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/632a1fd1327f068d6fd152ec_2F75Fk-C4f3waaitI-FpWuDIRuiMgHZr3tNnsnIafV-YPgDJ21lt8g_e9nRksCMtnpQVgbDNqp78r1ou3qocPqmxnnOknxPSK2vyNiB5EbE0ToLhOQE4pG7xdFWZZ-e0gdWPDviFbDzVolJFiLa3YlVlP_LwvZReiic4vGwgVqbZzHnY2ePmImPuGg.png\" alt=\"The Pause Invites confirmation window. It reads: “Invite links, embeds and [your custom invite link] will still be visible, but their usage will be paused. New users will no longer be able to join this server. Managing invites will still work.”&nbsp;\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Because this cuts off the flow of new arrivals, this can be an effective way to halt a raid in progress. Existing invites will be temporarily disabled without the need to delete them permanently, and well-intentioned community members trying to join will know that the pause is only temporary. Your future friend will be able to hold onto their invite and try again later on.</p>\n            <p>Once you and your moderation team are all situated, unpause your invites and everything will work as usual!&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>You’ll find the option to <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8458903738647-Pause-Invites-FAQ\">pause your server’s invites</a> in <strong>Server Settings &gt; Invites</strong>.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>Has a Raid Occurred? Let Us Know.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n            <p>Help us out by reporting raids using the new “Report Raids'' feature in your Server Settings drop-down. You can include information on what’s happened during the raid, including channel, DM and mention spam and even let us know about those suspicious “NotARobot” accounts.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width:\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/632a1fd1f1b890c4c3017b7a_FLgqUuNueYOlRqhhK5uFJE1zNqLjnW0yzfEi1o3_lBb0o4vNMHkvIV2A7Usg9Tj1rzK1rXLCPpoAWMOOvLQV3lxrUgr4rVpBxK4ZRppgxmMCo6ObsPorlcVnofcVW-3A_NnGBDM6YHa_ncukDGG2qHNE9g0ZkZ9fzqvyZ4m5XkX9EVL_jC5J3NuekA.png\" alt=\"The raid reporting pop-up inside Discord.

It’s always on in the background for Community-enabled servers, so you can rest assured that even if you don’t make your setup super-complex, we’ve still got your back.</p>\n            <p>All of this is designed to help safeguard your community around the clock, lower the strain on your moderation and admin team, and save you time. We couldn’t be more excited to give more time back to you to spend with your friends and help build wonderful communities together.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>AutoMod’s constantly evolving, as all good robots do, so keep an eye out in <strong>Server Settings &gt; AutoMod</strong> for when new features pop up! 🤖</p>\n            <p>Not using <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ\">AutoMod</a> yet?

If we haven’t met, we’re Discord’s La Cafetería Employee Resource Group (ERG for short), an employee-led, company-supported group that serves as a space where we can find community, have fun, and organize to help build a better workplace and better world.</p>\n            <p>Last year, we shared <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/discussing-latinx-heritage-month-with-discord-hispanic-erg-la-cafeteria\">our thoughts</a> on the term “Latinx.” For 2022, we’d like to talk about the theme of “Mejor unidos,” or “Better Together”.

And if we weren’t truly “Better Together,” we wouldn’t be an Employee Resource *<em>Group*</em>, would we?&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We sat down with a few fellow members of La Cafetería to learn about the way that communities can impact and uplift people together.

But text chat only accounts for a chunk of the features that Discord supports. Server roles, custom emojis, video calls, and more all contribute to the hundreds of terabytes of data we serve to our users.†</p>\n            <p>To provide this enormous amount of data, we run a set of NoSQL database clusters (powered by ScyllaDB), each one the source of truth for their respective data set. As a real-time chat platform, we want our databases to respond to the high frequency of queries as fast as possible.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:580pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62fa8baf6342b4bb5b594de7_Untitled.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A line graph containing &quot;Total Requests per Second by Cluster.&quot; There are multiple unlabeled lines shown, with the biggest takeaway being that the &quot;Requests per Second&quot; are consistently hovering around 2 million.\"></div>\n                <figcaption>Our databases were serving around 2 million requests per second (in this screenshot.)</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <h2><strong>Scaling Beyond Our Hardware</strong></h2>\n            <p>The biggest impact on our database performance is the latency of individual disk operations - how long it takes to read or write data from the physical hardware. Below a certain database query rate, disk latency isn't noticeable, as our databases do a great job of handling requests in parallel (not blocking on a single disk operation). But this parallelism is limited; at a certain threshold, the database will need to wait for an outstanding disk operation to complete before it will issue another. If you combine this with disks that take a millisecond or two to complete an operation, the database eventually reaches a point where it can no longer immediately fetch data for incoming queries. This causes disk operations and queries to \"back up\", slowing the response to the client who issued the query, which in turn causes poor application performance. In the worst case, this can cascade into an ever-expanding queue of disk operations whose queries time out by the time the disk is available. This is exactly what we were seeing on our own servers—the database would report an ever-growing queue of disk reads and queries would start timing out.</p>\n            <p>But wait: A millisecond or two to complete a disk operation? Why are we seeing this behavior when disk latency can usually be measured in microseconds?</p>\n            <p>Discord runs most of its hardware in Google Cloud and they provide ready access to “Local SSDs” — NVMe based instance storage, which do have incredibly fast latency profiles. Unfortunately, in our testing, we ran into enough reliability issues that we didn’t feel comfortable with depending on this solution for our critical data storage. This took us back to the drawing board — how do we get incredibly low latency when we can’t rely on the super-fast on-device storage?</p>\n            <p>The other main means of instance storage in GCP is called Persistent Disks. These are disks that can be attached/detached from servers on the fly, can be resized without downtime, can generate point-in-time snapshots at any time, and are replicated by design (to prevent data loss in the event that a single piece of hardware dies). The downside is that these disks are not attached directly to a server, but are connected from a somewhat-nearby location (probably the same building as the server) via the network.</p>\n            <p>While latency over a local network connection is low, it's nowhere near as low as over a PCI or SATA connection that spans less than a meter. This means that the average latency of disk operations (from the perspective of the operating system) can be on the order of a couple milliseconds, compared to half a millisecond for directly-attached disks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:undefinedpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62fa8c8fc8a25b2ae703b096_Untitled.png\" alt=\"A line graph labeled &quot;Disk latency, milliseconds, by device.&quot; It contains two lines: The &quot;Persistent Disk&quot; line is erratic, with the line rapily moving between 1 millisecond and 2 milliseconds. The &quot;Local Disk&quot; line is consistently round half a millisecond.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Local SSDs have other concerns, as well. As with traditional hard drives, the downside is that a hardware issue with one of these disks (or a disk controller) means we immediately lose everything on that disk. But worse than with traditional hard drives is what happens when the <em>host</em> has problems; if the host to which the Local SSDs are attached has critical issues, the disks and their data are gone forever. We also lose the ability to create point-in-time snapshots of an entire disk, which is critical for certain workflows at Discord (like some data backups). These missing features are why nearly all Discord servers are powered by Persistent Disks instead of Local SSDs.</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Evaluating the Problem</strong></h2>\n            <p>In a perfect world, we'd power our databases with a disk that combined the best properties of Persistent Disks and Local SSDs. Unfortunately no such disk exists, at least not within the ecosystem of common cloud providers. Asking for low latency directly-attached disks removes the abstraction that gives Persistent Disks their amazing flexibility.</p>\n            <p>But what if we didn't need <em>all</em> of that flexibility? For instance, write latency isn't critical for our workloads—it's read latency that has the biggest impact on application performance (due to our read-heavy workloads). And resizing disks without downtime isn't an important feature - we can better estimate our storage growth and provision larger disks ahead of time.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:580pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62fa8ca5c227ca1dd5478335_Untitled.png\" alt=\"A line graph labeled &quot;Disk Operations Per Second.&quot; There are two lines on this chart, with &quot;Reads&quot; hovering between 1.25 million and 1.5 million Reads Per Second.

It would be all too convenient if we could combine both disk types into one super-disk. Since our primary focus for disk performance was low-latency reads, we would love to read from GCP's Local SSDs (low latency) while still writing to Persistent Disks (snapshotting, redundancy via replication). But is there a way to create such a super-disk at the software level?</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Creating the Super-Disk</strong></h2>\n            <p>What we'd described with our requirement was essentially a write-through cache, with GCP's Local SSDs as the cache and Persistent Disks as the storage layer. We run Ubuntu on our database servers, so we were fortunate to find that the Linux kernel is able to cache data at the disk level in a variety of ways, providing modules such as <em>dm-cache</em>, <em>lvm-cache</em>, and <em>bcache</em>.</p>\n            <p>Unfortunately, our experimentation with caching led us to discover a couple pitfalls. The biggest one was how failures in the cache disk were handled: Reading a bad sector from the cache caused the entire read operation to fail. Local SSDs, a thin layer on top of NVMe SSD hardware, suffer from bad sectors like any other physical disk. These bad sectors can be fixed by overwriting the sector on the cache with data from the storage layer, but the disk caching solutions we evaluated either didn't have this capability or required more complex configuration than we wanted to consider during this phase of research. Without the cache fixing bad sectors, they will be exposed to the calling application, and our databases will shutdown for data safety reasons when encountering bad sector reads:</p>\n            <blockquote><em>storage_service - Shutting down communications due to I/O errors until operator intervention<br>storage_service - Disk error: std::system_error (error system:61, No data available)</em></blockquote>\n            <p>With our requirements updated to include \"Survive bad sectors on the Local SSD\", we investigated an entirely different type of Linux kernel system: <em>md</em></p>\n            <p><em>md</em> allows Linux to create software RAID arrays, turning multiple disks into one \"array\" (virtual disk). A simple mirrored (RAID1) array between Local SSDs and Persistent Disks would not solve our problem; reads would still hit the Persistent Disks for about half of all operations. However, <em>md</em> offers additional features not present in a traditional RAID controller, one of which is \"write-mostly\". The kernel man pages give the best summary of this feature:</p>\n            <blockquote><em>Individual devices in a RAID1 can be marked as \"write-mostly\". These drives are excluded from the normal read balancing and will only be read from when there is no other option. This can be useful for devices connected over a slow link.</em></blockquote>\n            <p>Since \"devices connected over a slow link\" just happens to be a perfect description of Persistent Disks, this looked like a viable strategy for proceeding with building a super-disk. A RAID1 array containing a Local SSD and a Persistent Disk set to write-mostly would meet all our requirements.</p>\n            <p>One last problem remained: Local SSDs in GCP are exactly 375GB in size. Discord requires a terabyte or more of storage per database instance for certain applications, so this is nowhere near enough space. We could attach multiple Local SSDs to a server, but we needed a way to turn a bunch of smaller disks into one larger disk.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:584pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62fa8e1dfb24ac7e3bc84e10_Untitled.png\" alt=\"A bar graph called &quot;Disk Used,&quot; showing how much Data is stored. While there are dozens of tiny lines, the main point of the graph is to show total amount of storage used, which is just under 768 Tebibytes of storage.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>‍</p>\n            <p><em>md</em> offers a number of RAID configurations that stripe data across multiple disks. The simplest method, RAID0, splits raw data across all disks, and if one disk is lost, the entire array fails and all data is lost. More complex methods (RAID5, RAID6) maintain parity and allow the loss of at least one disk at the cost of performance penalties. This is great for maintaining uptime—just remove the failed disk and replace it with a fresh one. But in the GCP world, there is no concept of replacing a Local SSD - these are devices located deep inside Google data centers. In addition, GCP provides an interesting \"guarantee\" around the failure of Local SSDs: If any Local SSD fails, the entire server is migrated to a different set of hardware, essentially erasing all Local SSD data for that server. Since we don't (can't) worry about replacing Local SSDs, and to reduce the performance impact of striped RAID arrays, we settled on RAID0 as our strategy to turn multiple Local SSDs into one low-latency virtual disk.</p>\n            <p>With a RAID0 on top of the Local SSDs, and a RAID1 between the Persistent Disk and RAID0 array, we could configure the database with a disk drive that would offer low-latency reads, while still allowing us to benefit from the best properties of Persistent Disks.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:622pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62fa8e85b2bb02210f63f001_Untitled.png\" alt=\"A chart displaying how Hardware and md interact.

In practice, this means our metrics show fewer outstanding database disk reads on super-disks than on Persistent Disks, due to less time spent on I/O operations.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:892pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62fa8e97c47c385a1c87a868_iowait.png\" alt=\"A line chart called “System iowait,” showing the times that Disks were spend idle before a new action was taken.” Persistent Disk is hovering around “8e-3,” while Super-Disk” sticker between “4e-3” and “2e-3.”\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>These performance increases let us squeeze more queries onto the same servers, which is great news for those of us maintaining the database servers (and for the finance department).<br>‍</p>\n            <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n            <p>In retrospect, disk latency should have been an obvious concern early on in our database deployments. The world of cloud computing causes so many systems to behave in ways that are nothing like their physical data center counterparts. The research and testing that went into developing our super-disk solution gave us many useful performance metrics to monitor, taught the team about the inner workings of disk devices (in both Linux and GCP), and improved our culture of testing and validating architectural changes. With super-disks introduced to production, our databases have continued to scale with the growth of Discord's user base.</p>\n            <p>Anyone who has ever worked with RAID before might be suspicious that such a setup would “just work” - there are a lot of systems at play in a cloud environment that can fail in fascinating new ways. &nbsp;There is more happening to support this disk setup than just a single <em>md</em> configuration. &nbsp;Expect a part two to this blog post that will go into more detail about the specific edge cases we’ve run into in the cloud environment and how we’ve solved them.</p>\n            <p>Lastly, if you like what you see here, come join us!

Direct messages to individuals or groups:</strong> There is an implicit expectation from the user to be getting a notification for content in this channel, for example, direct messages to a user on a messaging platform like Discord. From the recipient’s perspective, these could be:</p>\n            <p>a. time sensitive / urgent</p>\n            <p>b. important but not urgent, at least not urgent enough to notify them.</p>\n            <p>c. promotional / spam / scam direct messages</p>\n            <p><strong>2. Mentions / tags in content:</strong> Depending on the volume and frequency for the recipient (think a million people tagging Tom Cruise in tweets after Top Gun), we might want to optimize the channel for how much we believe a particular&nbsp; notification interrupts the user.</p>\n            <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Posts of followed users / topics (connected content)</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>4. All posts (unconnected content): </strong>For example, all messages in a Discord server.</p>\n            <p><strong>5. Creator / Platform driven: </strong>For example, promotions by creators/community hosts or recommendations by the platform for Groups to join, Users to add-friend, follow, and so on.<br><br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Channels:</strong></h2>\n            <p>These are surfaces where the user could be notified such as their email inbox, a push notification to their mobile device, or their notifications hub within an app. We have chosen not to include channels such as newsfeeds or homefeeds because those are surfaces a user visits to see content, i.e. action initiated by the user. The channels are avenues by which the platform reaches out to the user.</p>\n            <p><strong>1. New email notification</strong> - typically shows up in email and usually filtered out into the “promotions” tab by Gmail’s smartness.</p>\n            <p><strong>2. New push notification </strong>- typically shows up on the user’s phone if they have notifications enabled for this app.</p>\n            <p><strong>3. New in-app notification for logged in users </strong>- For example, an in-game notification in Roblox, or an in-app notification that a “friend” has started live streaming on a social network.</p>\n            <p><strong>4. New notification in the app’s notif-tab / inbox</strong> - This might or might not be accompanied by badging of the app icon. Usually this is a strict superset of (2) push notifs.</p>\n            <p><strong>5. Update an existing notification in the app’s notif-tab</strong> - For example if you post something on Instagram and you get 250 likes on it, you probably don’t want to see 250 different items in your notification tab about it. You probably want to see a single item there showing a few users who have liked and the total number of likes.<br><br></p>\n            <h2>Basic Framework</h2>\n            <p>At a high level we have inputs, i.e. sources of notifications, channels, and ways of getting in touch with users.

Today, anyone who uses Discord on an Android device to talk with their friends and communities will have plenty of reason to celebrate. That’s because Discord for Android is getting a major overhaul that brings significant improvements to the quality of the mobile experience.</p>\n            <p>Today, we’re excited to share some of the improvements Android users can expect to see on the Android app over the coming weeks, including:&nbsp;</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Feature consistency across platforms</strong> through a centralized and streamlined app development process across Android, iOS and desktop&nbsp;</li>\n                <li><strong>Faster app update release cycles </strong>when a new feature is introduced or a pesky bug is fixed thanks to a more consolidated process&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/627c1959c2c5e0379e245d4d_p6oMGrVaL_kf-5709fS2FUOdTSu0I4bOFWHeHO5ZoJuJC7RUyQbrdnZZnvWBZrGJriXc9abvwGy0aD5VnU7ipa-bjG07K_Ug9AU6qQcnt7C5xnHyQziRMg2iCOkkEooA8hl_TFhGhrJHASMmUw.png\" alt=\"An illustration of two Android phones side by side.

The right phone shows the new Roles setting page with updated icons, a new Reorder option, and easy access to the @everyone role’s permissions.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <h2><strong>Consistent Experience Across Every Platform</strong></h2>\n            <p>Historically, work on the Android implementation of new features would often be delayed until desktop and iOS were completed, resulting in some features that launched first on one platform before eventually arriving on another one. You may have noticed this when we share announcements of upcoming features with a note saying something along the lines of “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/discord/status/1503817340290584578?s=20&amp;t=Axb3w6G1I_1uL6i00PAQmA\">Android support coming soon</a>.”</p>\n            <p>Switching to React Native for the Android app means an experience that is ever-improving at a more rapid pace across every platform Discord is available on, while still retaining Android and iOS specific patterns in the UI. Design details and UI elements will also now be more aligned between desktop, iOS, and Android. New Android users who install the app for the first time will be greeted with a larger font within the app that is more consistent with iOS, and existing users have an option in settings to switch. </p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/627c19584b914b43b1e2e4d3_kPyompTaXjcZ37vAKYqbcBJDAFJ4g4f_uHjCu8Q99BwrT8DLaVmXDKmnx4K7tCC_DifprgA_hR_X5LobbXguipiCCDJaZR3qMVGINeSWBEzEgkpAyUBZxxqgpDDJUo_VIIpA5Hxg3jfWGGs3IA.png\" alt=\"An illustration of a computer monitor, laptop, iPhone, and Android phone lined up in a row.

React Native allows us to streamline and consolidate our processes, which helps our engineers work more efficiently and push out updates more frequently, especially now that the team won’t be spending as much time maintaining different codebases for different devices.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>As Discord continues to grow across platforms, we want to find ways to support you and your communities as quickly and efficiently as possible, regardless of which device or platform you happen to be using. Over the past few weeks, we’ve been rolling out the new version of our Android app, rebuilt from the ground up using the React Native development framework to create a better experience for all our users. Utilizing React Native across every mobile platform Discord is on is just one of the tools that helps us support what you do, and we can’t wait to show you how.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Want to see for yourself? If you already use Discord for Android, the app will automatically update across your devices in the coming weeks. If you’ve never used Discord for Android, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">you can download it on the Google Play Store</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Building a platform that users love is an ongoing and collaborative process at Discord. We’re so grateful to our community of awesome testers who have dedicated their time and effort over the past months to provide us with valuable feedback. Our team will continue to work on making the Android app the most quality app it can be.</p>\n            <p>We take user feedback very seriously and want to make sure what we’re introducing provides you with the best possible experience.

If you’ve ever been somewhere that offers alternative methods to traverse space, such as <a href=\"https://www.ada-compliance.com/ada-compliance/ada-ramp\">ramps next to staircases</a>, that’s one of the many ways of ADA in action. <br><br>Since the passing of the ADA act, the goal of Disability Pride Month has been to help eradicate stigma and encourage inclusion for all ability statuses. Disability Pride Month is recognized by organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.afb.org/blog/entry/celebrating-disability-pride-month\">National Foundation for the Blind</a>, <a href=\"https://ncil.org/resources/disability-pride-toolkit-and-resource-guide/\">National Council for Independent Living</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AAPD/status/1414693713889087498\">American Association of People with Disabilities</a>, and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CAPDisability\">Center for American Progress Disability Justice Initiative</a>.<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>The Disability Pride Flag</strong></h2>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62d076a599a03471847e6a05_7hroWrSqbARmZA9oSRDLFRxhjWOUshqSX9pESwB8KlV4EeHpV9HdbXPBTXkEfAQQH8iXr256OeK7Hv3a1kFDwfTuRkrhuo70W9m7EzQ1CuaGsOFxsmDD7IxqRzgyWck42AQdzWVbxnbUHpNG-rZWpw.jpeg\" alt=\"he Disability Pride Flag with 5 colored stripes laid out parallel to each other diagonally.\"></div>\n                <figcaption>Disability Pride Flag by Ann Magill, via <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/uhhdbv/the_disability_pride_flag_by_ann_magill_me_has/\">Reddit</a></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>The Disability Pride Flag (shown above) was designed by Ann Magill, a disabled poet and artist, and given a refresh in 2021 for improved accessibility.

If Discord’s indeed your home, your home should adapt for you, rather than you trying to make huge shifts in how you interact with Discord just to send a message, talk to a friend, or show them your new face tattoo over video. <br></p>\n            <p>Over the last few years, we’ve been adding and improving Discord in ways both big and small to benefit everyone. Every person on Discord brings a unique perspective and has different ways of relating to the world. To ensure we address the variety of use cases, we collaborate with a dedicated accessibility-focused community with fellow Discord users who navigate the app in unconventional ways, gaining valuable insight into what works, and what needs improvement.</p>\n            <p>Below are a few recently added highlights that help make Discord better for everyone:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408877527703\"><strong>Drag &amp; Drop via Keyboard</strong></a>: If you don’t use a mouse to navigate, you can use keyboard shortcuts to drag and drop content around.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010454681#h_01FF8RQ8EHR2T5PPCF9MZY1E1Y\"><strong>Text to Speech Speed Slider</strong></a>: If you use Text to Speech but the default speed in which the words are spoken is a little too slow (or fast) for you to comfortably use, feel free to adjust it to your heart’s content!</li>\n            </ul>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-script\">\n                <center>\n                    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-theme=\"light\">\n                        <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We just dropped two **improved** accessibility features on Discord to make our app more inclusive:<br><br>+ Accessible Drag &amp; Drop<br>+ Text-to-Speech Slider <a href=\"https://t.co/ndv5pUVodV\">pic.twitter.com/ndv5pUVodV</a></p>— Discord (@discord) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/discord/status/1441109814185132034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 23, 2021</a>\n                    </blockquote>\n                    <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </center>\n            </div>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040613412-Reduced-Motion-Setting\"><strong>Reduced Motion</strong></a>: Lowers the number of transitions, highlights, and animations throughout the app so you can better focus on the conversation at hand.</li>\n                <li><strong>Message Send Button</strong>: One of the newest additions, you can enable an optional button that you can use to send your message, rather than having to press the Enter key.</li>\n                <li><strong>Hugely Improved Keyboard Navigation &amp; Screen Reader Support</strong>: Take a look at our <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-implemented-app-wide-keyboard-navigation\">Keyboard Navigation engineering blog post</a> to learn how it all works under the hood.&nbsp;</li>\n                <li><strong>Visual Saturation Settings</strong>: Lowers how intense colors throughout Discord are.

For example, our limited-time Party Mode for our 7th Birthday turned off animations by default for users who have Reduced Motion on, and we made sure that Text Chat in Voice Channels was accessible to screen readers.</p>\n            <p>However, there’s always work to make the platform more inclusive to everyone and every body.

That is why safety is one of Discord’s most important priorities and investments as a company.</p>\n            <p>Our Engineering, Data, and Product teams work with safety principles in mind when building products. Our Policy team takes a nuanced and sophisticated approach to developing our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> and forms strategic partnerships with academics, civil society, industry peers, and moderators to advance our collective understanding of online safety. Our Trust &amp; Safety team works with cutting-edge technology to detect and respond to abuse, both proactively and from users, moderators, and trusted third party reporters.</p>\n            <p>This expansive effort and commitment to safety brings together around 15% of all Discord employees. We’re continuously expanding our efforts to help ensure that everyone can have a safer experience that allows for belonging on Discord.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Transparency is one of the core values of our safety work at Discord. These Transparency Reports are a way to demonstrate our commitment and provide insight into the enormous effort that goes into keeping Discord a safe place for all.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong>Report Structure Updates</strong></h2>\n            <p>As part of our ongoing commitment to be more transparent about the work that goes into keeping Discord safe, we’re doubling the number of Transparency Reports that we publish annually by moving from a semi-annual cadence to a quarterly cadence. This Report is our <a href=\"https://discord.com/tags/transparency-reports\">seventh since 2019</a>, and our first quarterly Report.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In making this transition, we’re changing the reporting period reflected in the data. This Report covers the first quarter of 2022, from January to March and will compare the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2021, from October to December.</p>\n            <p>We <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/important-policy-updates\">recently updated our Community Guidelines</a> to reflect several new and clarified policies which went into effect at the end of March. Since this Report covers Discord’s safety efforts during the first quarter of 2022, the enforcement actions documented in this report are based on the previous version of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <h2><strong>Community Guidelines Enforcement</strong></h2>\n            <p>Discord publishes and maintains a comprehensive set of <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> that explains what content and behavior is and isn’t allowed on Discord. We invest heavily in our proactive efforts to detect and remove abuse before it’s reported to us. Through advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized Safety teams tackling specific abuse situations, and partnering with experts outside the company, our team works to remove high-harm abuse before it is viewed or experienced by others.<br><br>We encourage users, moderators, and trusted reporters to submit reports if they believe an account or server is violating our Community Guidelines. We review and analyze these reports to determine if the content or behavior violates our Community Guidelines. Depending on the severity, we may take a number of enforcement steps including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; temporarily or permanently disabling or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible; and potentially reporting them to law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>This Report details the actions that Discord has taken on accounts and servers that have violated our Community Guidelines and <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a>.<br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Actions Taken on Accounts and Servers</strong></h2>\n            <h3><strong>Account and Server Warnings</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord provides warnings as an educational opportunity and as a support system to prevent future violations of our Community Guidelines. Warnings issued to accounts and servers are used frequently to correct problematic behavior that does not require immediate permanent removal from Discord. For some high-harm issues such as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) - a subcategory of Child Safety - we do not issue warnings but rather immediately disable the account, remove the content, and report the account to the <a href=\"https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline\">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> (NCMEC).</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62bcd598eb7da9ac66c3a376_VNz183cFpXvkxCPI4ucAw0nD_4TMrByAmkBpEai428NeB8USGaqH_ItCVOxY2u0U-tPGLWdnPNYGL-gYZB9lcrxC2icneIJZVebQLD2QAysc_DFSmMKzp5YhOjVM_xXLSJKpkbiZAQOyuXtQsoQ.png\" alt=\"A text chart showing warning types such as &quot;harassment and bullying&quot; and the number of servers and individuals warned, totaling over 2 million.\"></div>\n                <figcaption>The above chart breaks down warnings issued to individual accounts, servers, and server members.

Overall this represented a 29% increase in reports made to NCMEC when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62bcd67e76e970820787dea5_8OsIw-RfJkNhoSqawqzOSx5Yv1DBP81pLhw4O172ctfcDnc8esQQdAVA3RpMB8FO3gz_OcMC6Gs8d2gkooBa-o8b0UBZsQ4apyvMOucjcTDC3aSz9aKYVPCEU8CWlibd2yKw4HhZQmBVU0JkXQ.png\" alt=\"Bar graph displaying media reports by Month (January, February, March) and the number of grooming or endangerment escalations that Discord reported to NCMEC.\"></div>\n                <figcaption>An accessible text version of the reports filed to NCMEC chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-January---March-2022/blob/main/Q1%202022%20Transparency%20Report%20-%20NCMEC.csv\">on GitHub</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Discord disabled <strong>826,591 accounts</strong> and removed <strong>24,706 servers</strong> for Child Safety in the first quarter of 2022. Sexualized Content Regarding Minors (SCRM) is the single largest individual sub-category of accounts disabled within Child Safety, accounting for <strong>718,385 accounts</strong> disabled and <strong>22,499 servers</strong> removed.</p>\n            <p>Child-harm content is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord or the internet at large. We work with industry peers, civil society, and law enforcement to ensure that this effort extends beyond Discord. Discord is an active supporter of cross-industry programs such as NCMEC and is a member of the Technology Coalition. We’re also an annual sponsor of events dedicated to increasing awareness of and action on child safety issues such as the Dallas Crime Against Children Convention.</p>\n            <p>We have a dedicated team and invest heavily in advanced tooling and <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044154611-Talking-about-online-safety-with-your-teen\">education</a> so parents know how our service works and understand the controls that can contribute to creating a positive and safe experience on Discord for their children. As part of our ongoing commitment to parent engagement, Discord is a proud sponsor of National Parent Teacher Association and ConnectSafely. In recognition of Safer Internet Day in February, Discord and National PTA hosted an <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/discord-pta-collaboration-announcement-educators-parents\">event</a> to bring together parents, educators and teens to discuss online safety.

This category was the second-largest category of accounts disabled. These numbers were similar to the previous quarter, with one notable trend being that accounts disabled for Non-Consensual Pornography increased by 132% as a result of increased proactive efforts to remove this content from Discord.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Harassment and Bullying</strong></h3>\n            <p>Harassment and bullying have no place on Discord. Continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments, circumventing bans, suggestive or overt threats, the sharing of someone’s personally identifiable information (also known as doxxing), and server raiding are violations of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>During the first quarter of 2022, <strong>13,423 accounts</strong> were disabled for harassment-related behavior, and <strong>716</strong> <strong>servers</strong> were removed for this issue.

Compared to the previous quarter, this was a decrease of 6.5% for accounts and 18% for servers.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Identity and Authenticity</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of coordinating and participating in malicious impersonation of individuals or organizations is a violation of our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We disabled<strong> 154 accounts</strong> and removed <strong>16</strong> <strong>servers</strong> for this issue.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Platform Manipulation</strong></h3>\n            <p>Spam, fake accounts, and self-bots are examples of platform manipulation that damage the experience of our users and violate our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>During the first quarter of 2022, <strong>2,905 accounts</strong> and <strong>972</strong> <strong>servers</strong> were removed for platform manipulation-related issues not related to spam. An additional <strong>26,017,742 accounts</strong> were disabled for spam or spam-related offenses.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’re focused on combating spam and minimizing users’ exposure to spammers and spam content on Discord. We recently established a dedicated cross-functional anti-spam team combining Engineering, Data, Product, and Safety resources to tackle this issue, and we rolled out a one-click spam reporting feature that enables users to easily report spam. In the first quarter of 2022, 90% of accounts disabled for spam were disabled proactively – before we received any user report.</p>\n            <p>You can read more about how Discord fights spam <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-is-fighting-spam\">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Regulated or Illegal Activities</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of engaging in regulated, illegal, or dangerous activities is strictly prohibited, including selling or facilitating the sale of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods or services.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>19,669 accounts</strong> for engaging in this behavior.</p>\n            <p>A total of <strong>4,027 servers</strong> were removed for this category. Cybercrime had a proactive take down rate of 51%, with<strong> 1,996</strong> of the 3,883 servers removed proactively.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Self-Harm Concerns</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstance.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Actions may be taken on accounts or servers encouraging people to cut themselves or embrace eating disorders, or otherwise manipulating and coercing other users to engage in acts of self-harm. These actions are only taken on accounts glorifying or promoting acts of self-harm, not on users seeking help or in need of medical attention.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>1,795 accounts</strong> and removed <strong>594 servers</strong> for Self-Harm concerns.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent and Graphic Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>Real media depicting gore, excessive violence, the glorification of violence, or animal cruelty with the intent to harass or shock others is not allowed on Discord.</p>\n            <p>In the first quarter of 2022, <strong>16,069 accounts </strong>were disabled for posting violent and graphic content. 5,419 of these accounts were disabled for gore, and the remaining 10,650 accounts were disabled for content glorifying violence.&nbsp; This was a 34% decrease in accounts disabled for gore and a 64% increase in the number of accounts disabled for content glorifying violence.</p>\n            <p>We also removed <strong>1,657 servers </strong>for violent and graphic content. Of these, 291 servers were removed for gore and 1,366 servers were removed for content glorifying violence. The number of servers removed for gore decreased by 22% while the number of servers removed for glorification of violence increased by 89%.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent Extremism</strong></h3>\n            <p>We consider violent extremism to be the support, encouragement, promotion, or organization of violent acts or ideologies that advocate for the destruction of society, often by blaming certain individuals or groups and calling for violence against them.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord\">This blog post</a> discusses our methods to address violent extremism.

As a server continues to grow and responsibilities shift from helping out in your free time to spending every waking moment making sure memes aren’t posted in #general, you and your team may not be able to keep up and could burn out from not only moderating, but participating in your community entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>AutoMod is here to take some of the load off your shoulders, working to keep your community and conversations clean around the clock so you can take time to enjoy yourself without stressing about what's happening when you're out and about. As your one-stop-shop for content moderation filters, AutoMod lives under its own AutoMod tab within your Community-enabled Server Settings. (Don’t have Community enabled on your server?

You can even have users who try to post harmful words or phrases be Timed Out automatically, so they won’t be able to continue posting until you’re back.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/629e88d0ce0026bec3ed8599_cVVXT18gf6L-hohZJn2TIqxp7hvAHnmhIdaBsIg29OkZ3zjjEDB0oz7SIvBJ8dcgsm7RJ2XyoDSlkb2rF7ShOa9fkwkliK2y1fzM4FaxFvsXE0CMMy-0IJA_Bhe2JpkXleRbaNDvioA2k3Hkew.png\" alt=\"Two Discord screenshots side-by-side of AutoMod in action.

Back in 2020, we introduced the <a href=\"https://discord.com/moderation\" target=\"_blank\">Discord Moderator Academy</a>: a resource to equip moderators with guidance, mentoring, and training to understand common safety issues and other helpful ways to lead within their Communities.</p>\n            <p>We think of safety in three pillars at Discord - our internal Safety team works to ensure a safe and positive experience for users on the service, we provide tools for users to control who they interact with and how, and our community admins and moderators are at the forefront of enforcing Discord’s Community Guidelines, as well as their server’s own rules. As a server grows, mods and admins might find themselves dedicating an increasing amount of time to manually keep their server clear of unwanted behavior and content.</p>\n            <p>Community moderating should feel rewarding and fulfilling, and we want to make it easier for moderators to maintain a clean space for members by empowering them with better tools. AutoMod is one of the things we have built alongside other safety initiatives to help keep Discord safe for all Communities.</p>\n            <p>With AutoMod, moderators of all skill levels can quickly set up auto-moderation directly from server settings alongside pre-existing tools like Verification Levels, Slow Mode, and Server TimeOut. At launch, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters that automatically detect, block, and alert moderators of messages containing harmful words or phrases before they’re posted. AutoMod also gives moderators the ability to automatically time users out if a bad actor gets flagged, so your team can handle the situation when ready. </p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-iframe\">\n                <center>\n                    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cEgb_DEybo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n                </center>\n            </div>\n            <p><br>We’ve compiled three starting lists that cover certain categories of not-nice words or phrases within a default Rule called “Commonly Flagged Rules.” Moderators can also experiment with up to three additional custom rules sets, allowing AutoMod to take action on anything your team wants it to.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:90%px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/629e88d135066e31cbdfe76d_X4eoV2lsn6-Jnkpb3GI57mNF1AQcuSh8D3kvUy21DblrMAzGPUDilqvi5_t4r1FFYz_NSydGYR9-12cAxjcJ8GakiyAERTl0KZVPsuWzfEodAKQZ0KhOYr_pUO8Nr3j4-6WgreoQ7387uj9vGQ.png\" alt=\"Discord AutoMod settings page, with a customizable list of rule name, words belonging to the rule, responses of &quot;Block Message&quot;, &quot;Send an alert&quot;, and &quot;Timeout user&quot;, and exempt roles and channels.\"></div>\n                <figcaption>You can specify what words AutoMod looks for, along with what actions to take.

Here we go. Posted.” <br>“You posted in the wrong #voice-chat-spam! You’re supposed to use #voice-chat-spam-3.”<br><br>If you’ve been on Discord for some time, you’re probably very familiar with how Voice channels work. Whether it’s to pop in to talk about last night’s game, show a friend your cool new haircut over video, or share your screen to collab on editing your new hyperpop track, you can do it all from within a Voice channel on Discord.</p>\n            <p>All, except for one thing: Text chat.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Currently, if you want to share something you’re talking about in Voice, your options are to:&nbsp;</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>DM it to every person individually,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>Post it in #general where people will get confused as to why you posted a video about stoats, or…</li>\n                <li>Make a new Text channel specifically for that Voice channel called #voice-spam. If you have multiple Voice channels, you’ll probably make a companion text channel for each one.&nbsp;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>A Discord server should have a home for any conversation, including a space where those in Voice can collaborate and share whatever they want. Now, there’s finally a proper home for those looking to post things to share with their friends participating in a call: <strong>Text chat in Voice channels</strong>.</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-iframe\">\n                <center>\n                    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlEAb60EYWU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n                </center>\n            </div>\n            <p>Now, every Voice channel has its own dedicated messaging space. No need to post a GIF in #general with no context, or make sure you’re posting in the right #voice-chat channel. No matter what you’ve got to share, everyone in your voice conversation knows exactly where to look. <br><br></p>\n            <h2><strong>How Does Text Chat in Voice Channels Work?</strong></h2>\n            <p>With each Voice channel having its own text chat, anyone hanging out in Voice now has a space to send messages, post links, and more easily engage in the conversation, even if you’re the one who might not have a mic. Got a link to share with your Voice chat buddy? Plop it in the Text chat, that way anyone joining in later can check it out as well and immediately get context about what everyone else is discussing.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/623ba1ebf404f1c6af94658f_jePivqWBy9jJUuSQeiCJ1lhWrdxOHntPGuMBw5VsgyPiVGVcqnobsUs3e0LO49tgUKqMJW7tDFKugPTZ8Dqf63LVrfXDahjwJzh6tiGDVe6hm0O2-1vtMo4jHTEV8hn5WC9wa2nL.gif\" alt=\"An ongoing conversation about tea within a Discord voice channel.

For starters, <strong>all Voice channels now have a dedicated Chat bubble icon</strong>, ready for any and every message, link, emoji, sticker, or GIF your heart desires to post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>When someone posts in a Voice channel’s chat you’re participating in, you’ll see new message previews pop up on the top right-hand corner of the app. Stay caught up without having to open chat each time someone posts; even those without a mic will feel more involved when their message pops up for everyone to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/623ba1eb7d046008a7feb0e4_m2zvqnl_yAzlRcTCTGvUdjCJl5VxqmHXVxU2y-z-aEfC9B6iJHtSpAUlYF91Jl3K9sJYGPz1Z7vm3SS9lEXxjRr9ns68-OhJ6N5x8qoZ0nXMwY-du4eHspIAEOAw-B2VIKNP-1xE.gif\" alt=\"An ongoing conversation about tea within a Discord voice channel. When someone posts a message, a notification appears showing the content posted, and who posted it.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>You can also check in on a Voice channel’s chat without joining the call itself, just in case you want to recollect that one link that everyone laughed at — just hover over the Voice channel and press the Chat button.</p>\n            <p>The best part? <strong>Using Text chat within Voice channels is free for every server, big or small.</strong> If your server happens to have additional features from boosting, such as increased file upload limits, they’ll work in your Voice channel’s Text chat as well.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>A Text Chat Voice Chat Chat: Moderating For Your Chats&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/connect-the-conversation-with-threads-on-discord\">Just like Threads before it</a>, the new Text chat space within your server’s Voice channels is another surface that you may need to plan out server moderation for.&nbsp; To help community servers prepare, we’re giving server owners and mods the opportunity to choose what roles can text chat in the Voice channel, and which Voice channels have this new embedded chat. Want to get ahead of @JoeShmoe hogging chat with conversation about his ant farm, or ensure everyone is speaking in #SeriousConvos only? Feel free to adjust accordingly before releasing Text in Voice to your community.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Thankfully, things won’t change too drastically! Since all Voice channels now have a Text chat, Voice channels also now have access to all the same text-based permissions in a new category called Voice Channel Chat Permissions, including <strong>Send Messages, Add Reactions, Use External Emoji</strong> and <strong>Use External Stickers</strong> among all the others you’re used to.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1037pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/623ba1eb5d37e411b0afb2a4_AFZAPQ4vwJGoV8FTuQD-Rup8wRElkzNp0K2oMVIryHOpkvuOHRG8V4LXGqgYp6Nk1px6S4eMZ3m2hgdehrYgRiWrFMRKTNgqwOvdzaFdLAAFPFyLwo8Rs_nsCK9IpoaxF6eHxGSm.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a Voice channel’s permissions page. The Permission settings for Voice channel chat are displayed, including: Send Messages, Embed Links, Attach Files and Add Reactions.\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>If any of your existing roles already have these permissions enabled — and they likely do, otherwise it’d be rather difficult to use existing Text channels — then your members will also be able to post in your Voice channel chats. If you don’t want someone to post in Voice chat, just disable any necessary permissions for the channel or category.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>But… when will your community be able to use Voice channel chat for talking the night away? If you happen to remember <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/connect-the-conversation-with-threads-on-discord\">how Threads slowly released</a>, it’ll be a pretty similar process. If you don’t remember or never knew Threads rolled out slowly, no worries — let’s discuss how Voice channel chat will come out: <br><br><strong>Starting today, servers that haven’t become a “Community” server via Server Settings will be able to automatically access Text Chat in Voice Channels.</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>Servers that have “Community” turned on can opt-in to Text Chat in Voice Channels:</strong></p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1026pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6296535d67bedde44390d861_EZhS8A609jNz71vdfiNnLM91m7HnnLPtPBt7GFIyU1LnlcXgaXSEtHOaf-p9iJE0Hqv07D_YsINwEwcaQnJH2kcnbmzJXc69A8ImDStaNA13NANLltXhDpaSO_DviIuy_9LRJa-JoleStuwz_Q.png\" alt=\"The screenshot of the Text in Voice opt-in screen. It shows the date of when the option will be enabled by default for all servers. \"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>We’ve also worked with our biggest bot and library developers to help get updated ahead of launch — it’s fairly likely that a moderation bot you use has already been updated to be able to sus out malicious content in your Voice channel’s text chat.<strong>‍</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>By June 29th, 2022, all servers, including Community servers, will have Voice channel chat enabled, while still respecting the role and voice channel permissions you have already prescribed</strong>, and the world will see fewer and fewer Text-only channels named #voice-spam or #voice-chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br>‍</strong>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>Chit-Chat in Voice Text Chat: Chat in Voice Starting Now</strong></h2>\n            <p>We had a tough time thinking about what to name this feature. Is it “Voice chat chat?” “Voice Text”? “Text chat for voice chat?” Or can you now “Talk in Voice Chat's Text Chat?” <br><br>But no matter how you talk about it, we hope being able to use Text chat within your Voice channels for posting whatever you want makes talking, organizing your communities, or simply spending time with your closest friends that much easier.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Text Chat in Voice Channels</strong> is available on all platforms Discord is on: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and your browser of choice via the web app. As usual, we’ve got a <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4412085582359\">Help Center article</a> for those who want the full scoop on how things work.</p>\n            <p>We’re always looking for ways to improve your experience on Discord. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/discord\">Shoot us a tweet</a>, or post on our feedback form, if you’ve got ideas of your own.<br></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"column-4 w-col w-col-8 w-col-stack\">\n    <div id=\"heading-1\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2>What’s happening to apps?</h2>\n            <p>If you use apps frequently on Discord or have used them in the past, you may notice a couple things have changed. First, apps can do all sorts of new party tricks they haven’t been able to do before - that’s because in the past year we’ve built a variety of new features for developers to play with (buttons, attachments, localized commands!) and make their apps more accessible and fun.</p>\n            <p>Secondly, we’re also standardizing how app commands work so they’re easier and safer to use. In a nutshell, the ‘old way’ was talking to a bot (e.g. sending a message, which it would read) to tell it what to do. The ‘new way’ is to type a slash <strong>“/”</strong> to bring up a menu of available commands in the server, so you can select the one you want. These are called <strong>Slash Commands.</strong> We love using them, and we know millions of you who are using them already do, too!</p>\n            <p>You can try it now with our oldest bot friend, <a href=\"https://airhorn.solutions/\" target=\"_blank\">Airhorn</a>. Add it to your server, then type “/” and see what it can do for you. Tip: Next time one of your chats on voice is winding down from a serious discussion, use <strong>/gavel</strong> to adjourn everyone. (Feels nice, doesn’t it?)</p>\n            <p>Our wonderful developer community has been working on migrating their existing apps to this new command system: this means some apps are still on the old, some are fully on the new, and some are still offering both - to give you time to get the hang of the new ones.</p>\n            <h3>TLDR:</h3>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>For verified apps (bots that have a checkmark displayed), Slash Commands are the new standard for interacting with them. Huzzah!</strong></li>\n                <li><strong>For unverified apps (bots that don't have a checkmark), you may still be using text commands when you interact with them, depending on what the developer prefers.</strong></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p><strong>September 1, 2022 is the final switchover date. This means that, if the developer of one of the apps you’re using has <em>not</em> made the switch yet, parts of the app might not work after that time.</strong></p>\n            <p>We’ve given lots of notice to developers that this migration is happening, but if you have questions or are concerned about it, definitely reach out to them in their support server or website and check in.</p>\n            <p>Read on to celebrate and learn about the results of this work - and all the cool things developers can now do with apps and bots!</p>\n            <h2>New party tricks</h2>\n            <p>Whether an app uses these features depends on whether the developer chooses to implement them - and what kind of app it is and what it does - but they are all available now, and we’re seeing more and more great examples every day!</p>\n            <h3><strong>Easier to use</strong></h3>\n            <p><strong>1. Introducing the command picker!</strong> When you type “/” a handy menu of available slash commands pops up. At the top, you’ll see commands you use most often.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:887pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/628572088b1d3cf52023fc2a_11111_command-picker.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p><strong>2. Jump to the app you want to avoid confusion with similar commands</strong>. In the command picker you’ll also see a list of app icons - all their available commands are alphabetized, so clicking on an app will bring you straight to the relevant ones. (You’ll never accidentally do the wrong /play again.)<strong>‍</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>3. Your most recent commands are at the top</strong>. For all those go-to commands, you can access them more easily with the “frequently used” section at the top of the picker.<strong>‍</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>4. Autocomplete for interactions.</strong> Every second counts in a busy day - save some time typing out long phrases with our support for autocomplete when using commands or searching in menus.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>New things to do</strong></h3>\n            <p><strong>1. Buttons!!!</strong> So fun, so colorful, so... self-explanatory. A great example of buttons making things easier is as an alternative for using reaction emojis with a bot (like to have it assign you a role). It might not seem that different, but on the backend, clicking a button is <em>much</em> better for developers because it helps the bot be more efficient - and run faster.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1852pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6285726945c9b57331824694_3333_reaction-replacement.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Buttons come in multiple colors, and can even be a mini-game themselves. They can can also support links, making it easy to direct folks where you need them to go.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1400pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62857316414c2430b5f312c8_4444_command-buttons.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>‍<strong>2. Select menus</strong>. These are dropdowns, which helps a bot offer a long list of choices while making it easier to scroll and select, which saves tons of space (and time).</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62857374acb30b41b8c616c5_5555.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p><strong>3. Context menus can have commands in them!</strong> This is a lesser-known but super convenient method of accessing an app command quickly in a way that feels native to Discord - but it’s customized just for you. Here’s a little breakdown of what this feature is:</p>\n            <p>Right-clicking on things like channels, categories, and users will bring up what we call a context menu:</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1188pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/628573ac727dc3b5ff1ca295_66666.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>If an app has commands that are specific to certain areas of Discord, they can live directly in that context menu for easier access. For example, a command that does something particular for a channel could be added directly to the channel context menu.</p>\n            <p>Any context menu with commands added will have an additional option on the menu that says “Apps.”</p>\n            <p>Hovering over “Apps” will display any commands. You’ll see the app icon next to them, to help you know which app is doing this task for you and help you make sure you’re using the right one, if there are multiple.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1166pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/628574c94a0cbcb9e6193f5a_77777.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Selecting the command tells the app to do the task immediately - unlike the command picker, which may give you a few choices first or require you to hit ‘enter’ before it executes the task. This means baking commands into context menus where they’re used the most will save you a little time. Note: context menu commands do not appear in the command picker.</p>\n            <h3><strong>Safer</strong></h3>\n            <p><strong>1. Ephemeral messages!</strong> These are messages a bot sends to you that are viewable <em>only</em> to you - there are plenty of situations where this comes in handy, but a really common way you’ll see this used is when an interaction you tried to do didn’t work properly: developers can set errors to be ephemeral, which means it keeps the chat clean and tidy. And aside from keeping dirty laundry out of view, ephemeral messages can also be a fun way to interact privately (without DMing you!) - which means you can use them when you’re playing a game and need to make moves without other people seeing (ssh).</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1802pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/628574eb8dbc9d04f98f58bd_8888_ephemeral-message-game.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p><strong>2. Command permissions system</strong>. We recently announced this shiny new Integrations page, which has a fully customizable menu for commands. Moderators and admins who want to add new apps to their servers often need to make sure they can control where slash commands can be used - what channels, and by whom - and even <em>which</em> commands can be used. (Everyone should be able to use /help in any channel, but maybe /puppies should just be in the #pet-motivation channel - and /ban is for admins only.) With command permissions, slash commands become an even stronger improvement from the old command methods, as they become more flexible and customizable to your server’s needs.

Here’s how to add it to your own server!</strong></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Click on the bot (the ‘user’ part of the app, shown in the members list) to open up its bot user profile</li>\n                <li>Click the ‘Add to Server’ button</li>\n                <li>Choose what server to add it to (the list will show all servers for which you have the ‘manage server’ permission).</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>If you don’t see the ‘Add to Server’ button, it might be because the developer hasn’t enabled it yet. They can do this easily in the developer portal any time.</p>\n            <p><strong>Have questions? Reach out to the developer!</strong></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Some devs have support servers or community servers for fans. It’s a great way to explore and practice using the app before you bring it into your own server, too. Many devs also ask for feedback and suggestions.</li>\n                <li>All Discord Developers are required to have a Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy for their apps, so if you have any questions, they are available.

We were devastated to learn the suspect had written of his intentions in his private Discord server.</p>\n            <p>We extend our deepest sympathy to the victims and families of the shooting, and the communities to which they belong. The massacre was a hate crime and a stark display of the grave dangers of white supremacy. We denounce white supremacy and actions that stem from it in the strongest possible terms.</p>\n            <p>Immediately upon learning of the attack, we began cooperating with law enforcement regarding the suspect’s activity on Discord. While there are limitations to what we can share due to an ongoing investigation, below is what we can confirm at this time:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>The suspect kept a personal diary of his plans within a private Discord server, which was visible only to him.</li>\n                <li>This private server and personal diary within were not visible or accessible to other Discord users prior to the afternoon of May 14, 2022.</li>\n                <li>During the 30 minutes leading up to the attack, the suspect shared invitations to view his private server with this personal diary within a small number of other private servers and direct messages (DMs). The invitations were only available in these servers and DMs and were not accessible to the broader Discord community.</li>\n                <li>15 users clicked on the invitation and would have had access to his private server and its content. No one else joined. </li>\n                <li>We did not receive any reports about his activity or the contents of his private server at any point prior to the attack.</li>\n                <li>We are aware that the suspect was active elsewhere on Discord, but we have not found any references to his attack plans outside of his private server.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>These are the actions we have taken so far:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Banned the suspect’s account, removed the private Discord server containing the personal diary, and archived the server’s contents for a thorough investigation. </li>\n                <li>Expedited our production of evidence to law enforcement, including the FBI, to ensure their investigation can proceed quickly.</li>\n                <li>Partnered with industry groups, including the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, to advise and assist in collaborating with other tech companies as we investigate.</li>\n                <li>Implemented measures to prevent the spread of content related to the attacks. &nbsp;</li>\n                <li>Identified and removed accounts of malicious actors who we found to be creating fake Discord chat logs to trick law enforcement and media outlets. </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Safety is a vital priority for our company and 15% of all Discord employees work in this area. We use a mix of proactive and reactive measures which include automated search tools, empowering community moderators to uphold our policies, and also providing reporting mechanisms for users and community moderators to surface violations for us to action. The Safety team investigates and takes prompt action when we receive a report about illegal activity or policy violations.</p>\n            <p>We understand hateful ideologies and proponents of organized violence will persist online and offline, and we acknowledge that we must do more to remove hate and violent extremism from Discord. We created Discord to be a place for people to find belonging, and hate and violence are in direct opposition to our mission. We take our commitment to these principles seriously and will continue to invest in and deploy resources.</p>\n            <p>Combating hate, violence, and extremism is the responsibility of all of us, online platforms included, and our work here never stops.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

Think about that for a second: we’ve been around for <em>seven whole years</em>. A lot can happen in that time, and nothing makes that clearer than looking at where we are versus where we started from. Did you know that when we first launched, there was no friends list? You couldn’t direct message people, either. And most shockingly of all, Light theme was <strong>mandatory</strong><em>. (horror movie strings)</em></p>\n            <p>So we’re taking some time to celebrate seven awesome years with all of you. On the party agenda: special birthday weekend features, a special animated video background for everyone to use, and new threads to wear under the summer skies.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>So come on — strap a hat on and follow us! We left a slice of cake there for you.

As a special celebratory measure this weekend, desktop and web users will have a new feature waiting for them: <strong>Party Mode</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/627c14b24a9e9a25f0fef9ae_hn4Ppmt2L4JyDUA2a07bV4y8UvDnc_C6tNIFn_QBuNSN0qxn9Z-AeE4Iy_FKxkN9Aacixk1GZkN4blTHb0oEj5Qq7ovA3uoK8VXjz44KNNZjdGFfPNrZuRzHU023akfFILx4EQ5kX1TozbjcZA.gif\" alt=\"A user is typing a long message in Discord.

Crowds will cheer and your typing field will tremble as your Combo meter increases. Yes, we said <strong>Combo meter.</strong> It’s the most scientific way of measuring Hype ever devised.</p>\n            <p>Of course, it’s your party too, so you can customize all the details. Going into the Party Mode tab presents you with options to tailor your whole festive experience. And something about… Achievements? You’ll have to check out Party Mode yourself to see what they are.</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/627aa3816cfb523e7c503e45_3wryUv4025vEMoObCc5v7hqEyH8dBSOqHKM3W7GCLvtDWF9oqv8UdwBlcdqRFJRTgbz6yiqNQv6KkHBJjSirfcmYSL0ihwmWY0SgPG4sYhkSRs5pOhvViLG9nrgqXQ1dZrM3ehayagBwXTExjw.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of Discord’s new Party Mode settings menu.

Or much less confetti, but normal screen shake? Or more screen shake? Or <em>EVEN MORE</em> screen shake? Being the party controller means you set the vibe anywhere from “low key” to “borderline unusable,” and there are no wrong answers.</p>\n            <p>Party Mode is opt-in, so don’t worry — you won’t get jumpscared by confetti this weekend. Plus, if you’ve previously enabled Reduced Motion in the Accessibility Settings, Party Mode will default to a very gently festive experience: screen shake and confetti will be turned off unless you disable Reduced Motion.</p>\n            <p>There’s even more to Party Mode, so check out the Help Center article <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/5706956956695\">here</a>. It’s kinda like the instruction manual for your party’s inflatable bounce house: you don’t <em>have </em>to read it before you dive in headfirst, but, you know, it’s definitely there.</p>\n            <p>Party Mode will be available for the birthday weekend until May 16th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong>Discord’s Newest Merch Drop is Here: Idle Nights 🌙</strong></h2>\n            <p>The Idle Night collection is a chill mood distilled.

Check out the nearly-17,000 community signatures collected for the final banner over at <a href=\"https://thankyoudiscord.com/\">thankyoudiscord.com</a>.</p>\n            <p>We hope you’ll be able to check out the celebrations throughout the weekend. From confetti and poolside vibes inside the app to repping Discord outside of it, there’s something for both the hard-partying and the soft-celebrating alike.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>It’s been a wonderful seven years. Every day, we get to build a place where close friends come together, relationships are built, and just saying “hi” can lead to a lifetime of memories. We’re so thankful to be a part of all your journeys.

We’re Discord’s Asian American and Pacific Islander Employee Resource Group. It’s a bit of a mouthful, so ‘round these parts we call ourselves the “AAPI ERG” for short. We’re a group of around 150 Discordians who identify as anything from AAPI members to allies, gamers, hot pot enthusiasts, and everything in between.</p>\n            <p>The past year plus has been an especially tough time for our AAPI communities. We cannot ignore the pain and trauma we’ve endured and are continuing to endure, and so we wanted this year’s celebration to be an extra special celebration of our unique cultures, heritage, passions, achievements, and selves. A time to show some extra love to ourselves as individuals.</p>\n            <p>For the month of May, we’re celebrating the things that make each of us unique. Below, you’ll see the quotes of various members of the AAPI ERG discussing the ways we’ve broken free from various molds and expectations. Some bring laughter, some follow with deep self-reflection, and even sorrow, but it all comes together in one singular topic: embracing who you truly are.</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed\">\n                <hr class=\"hr-style\">\n            </div>\n            <h2>More than just Asian…</h2>\n            <p>Many of us have experienced being perceived as simply “Asian”. Or perhaps folks try to guess our ethnicity and make generalizations from there. For others, especially those who aren’t East Asian, we’re often not even considered anything under the AAPI umbrella. But beyond the label of Asian, each of us identifies ourselves using far more than just Asian-specific labels.</p>\n            <p>From ex-ballerina, to PC gamer, escape room enthusiast, hiker, third culture kid, musician, empath, spicy food enthusiast, photographer, friendly troll, (<em>inhale) </em>introvert whisperer, diver, meme lord, word nerd mentor, community builder, isekai degenerate, mechanical keyboard enthusiast—each of us describes ourselves in a multitude of ways.</p>\n            <h2>…and unique in our experiences</h2>\n            <p>‍<em>“I'm so thankful my parents put me in many different extracurricular activities during my childhood, as </em><strong><em>I've been able to feel unique in my ability to wear many different hats and not being afraid to be the first to try new things.</em></strong><em> Learning how to manage my time allowed me to take on internships during college, leading me to be one of the youngest employees at Discord!

Although I chose a path that was different from the expectations of society, the path I wanted, it came with taxing consequences. Even though parts of it were rewarding, and I still enjoyed the work overall, I was able to see why this path wasn't a normal expectation due to its ramifications.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“The first time I went against my parent's expectations was when I decided to drop out of STEM, which was an incredibly scary process. I wasn't sure if I would've been disowned at the time, but luckily my family was a lot more supportive of my decision than I thought.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“I left BigLaw to go work in Europe for four years. It was the first big decision I'd made that went against my parents' expectations and the career path that was expected by people in law. It was scary and possibly a career dead end, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made: I got to travel, have a life outside of work, do things my way without a lot of scrutiny, and figure out what I liked and didn't like on my own.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“To be honest, it's still a challenge sometimes to balance blending in and seeming normal, but still wanting to be true to myself.”<br></em></p>\n            <h2>…while navigating our relationship with heritage and culture</h2>\n            <p><em>“During COVID &amp; whenever I go back to my parents house, we play mahjong! This was such a great way to keep us connected to our culture, speak more Cantonese, and bond through a game that my grandma still plays each day.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“My family practices Buddhism and a lot of our culture is passed down through traditions found in our religious practices. I also try to stay as tuned into the community as possible, mostly through volunteering for immigrant communities.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“One of the easiest ways that I have found is through food; I've always loved cooking, and learning how to cook Korean food has been a way to start conversations and connections. I'm also slowly learning the language and plan to travel to Korea one day.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“I'm a part of the AAPI ERG committee, so my day-to-day includes talking to the committee members and constantly planning fun activities. Otherwise, I love to bond with other ERG members through movie sessions or discussions about current events!”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“Sadly, I don't, really. Right now, being Asian is mostly about food preferences and trying to silence my inner tiger parent.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“I've lived and studied in over 14 countries since elementary school, so finding a new home away from home is important to me. Music is just one of those things you can always find anywhere at anytime.”</em></p>\n            <h2>The effect of generalizations…</h2>\n            <p><em>“From my experience, there are assumptions around the \"weird stuff\" that people eat in Asian culture. We can combat these negative impacts by showcasing the cultural significance behind some of the food we eat such as certain dim sum dishes.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“To name one endemic to tech: the model minority myth really erases any reasoning that Asians may need any type of help or assistance structurally. I think one thing we can really do is talk about what it means to be Asian outside of a predominantly east Asian lens. When I say Asian, most people tend to think of the big 3 which are Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. But there is so much disaggregated data on how specific ethnicities within the Asian category are some of the highest in poverty, lowest on education, etc.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“A significantly negative generalization of AAPI culture is that Asians naturally perform better in education. Although I do think in some cultures, Asian mentality surrounding education may be quite toxic. I don't think there is a definitive answer fit for every scenario, but understanding boundaries and expectations helps with at least your own personal growth development.”</em></p>\n            <p><em>“Instead of responding back with frustrated emotions, we could use this as an educational moment for those with misunderstandings. We can respond with grace and help them understand. Furthermore, we can take this one step further and ask them about their own culture. At the end of the day, they could clarify our generalizations about their culture too.”<br></em></p>\n            <h2>….affects more than just us</h2>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6269c7cc7f24e8b7e9e3a36b_oCdONJlYtntay-FUFuCrjGnHE8zY0_WFuesP5z3FBZjmMXcZqpw2VWd5Pwbsx68JJ67uTNK4srnP_fM_SRXQwnn73Zf-XrscpogqwYdWJwKuCgqRz_-hj039_JnBVVY8HUy70yC9.png\" alt=\"Quote text reading: &quot;Just like how we want to support other BIPOC, our differences as AAPI groups, are really what makes us who we are.

(Okay, not that last one, but now that we wrote it, our very talented developer community will probably have something built within the hour.)</p>\n            <p>And <strong>now there’s a brand-new page for admins in Server Settings: Command Permissions</strong>! Head to a server where you’re an admin and look under the <strong>Integrations tab</strong>: here, you can <strong>customize which commands can be used, in what channels, and by which roles</strong>.</p>\n            <h2><br>...Wait, what are these commands again?</h2>\n            <p>Just over a year ago, we introduced you to <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-are-here\">slash commands</a>. In the olden days, you used to have to type messages out (a.k.a. text commands) in a public channel to talk to a bot. This meant you needed to know exactly what the right command word was - or worse, you’d need to try a bunch of magic words until you lucked out and found the right one, all of which would clog up that very important chat about which action movies count as holiday movies.</p>\n            <p>With slash commands, typing a “/” brings up a command picker where you can view all the commands available to you, along with a description of what they do so you can select the one you want. Now it’s as easy as /yippee-kai-yay.</p>\n            <div class=\"w-embed w-iframe\">\n                <center> <iframe max-width=\"560\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XxcpBxSCiU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></center>\n            </div>\n            <h2><br>...I’m still using text commands though.</h2>\n            <p>We’re glad you pointed that out. The apps you love are built and managed by very talented persons or teams — if they built it before slash commands were introduced, it means they need to do a little work to make the changes. Moving to new ways of doing things takes time, and we care a lot about our devs who create all these cool and fun things you get to do in your server together.</p>\n            <p>Developers have had access to slash commands since late 2020, and last summer we shared that slash commands will be the preferred way to handle our message content requirements. This is because, in addition to the aforementioned issue around clogging the chat (/fetch /nothappening /pleasestoptryinggretchen), slash commands strengthen Discord’s privacy protections and provide a more standardized experience across the platform.</p>\n            <p>If you type “/” you’ll see on the side of the command picker all the apps (that have commands) in that server, so you can jump straight there or use the handy list we keep at the top for you of commands you use most often. Some apps may have similar commands, and the difference between /yipee and /yipee-kai-yay is CRITICAL to get right. The stakes are high.</p>\n            <p>So if you use any apps and bots today, here are some things to know:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li><strong>Currently, your server’s app may have both text commands <em>and</em> slash commands.</strong> Be aware that (<em>most</em>*) text commands will go away later this year, so it’s a good idea to get in the habit of <strong>using slash commands now</strong>! They’re easier to learn for new users, but if you’re in the habit of sending text commands, you might want to train yourself to use slash commands today.</li>\n                <li><strong>If your app has no slash commands, that means your developer hasn’t migrated to them yet</strong>. You can visit their support server or contact them to let them know - they might be juggling a lot, life can get busy! - but just know that there are only a few months left. After this phase is complete, we’ll be making changes on the backend that might make apps that haven’t updated themselves yet not work properly. This brings us to...</li>\n                <li><strong>Apps that don’t evolve may break later if your developer doesn’t switch over — we’re still a ways away, but we wanted you to know!</strong> We work with our developer community over on the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/KdVhyy4DwN\">Discord Developer server</a> and provide tips, tricks, and support.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>There are <em>tons</em> of improvements we’ve made to slash commands over the past year and a half: some improvements you may have noticed (attachments!), some you’ll notice very soon. For example, we started rolling out out the ability to start localizing commands on desktop and iOS, so you’ll soon be able to <strong>see commands in your preferred language</strong> if they’re supported!

That is why safety is one of Discord’s most important priorities and investments as a company.</p>\n            <p>Our Engineering, Data, and Product teams work with safety principles in mind when designing and building products. Our Policy team takes a nuanced and sophisticated approach to developing our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, our Community Moderation team trains and empowers moderators to keep their communities safe and healthy, and Trust &amp; Safety works with cutting-edge technology to detect and respond to abuse, both proactively and from user reports.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>This expansive effort and commitment to safety brings together around 15% of all Discord employees. As Discord continues to grow, welcoming more users and evolving as a platform, we’re continuously expanding our efforts to help ensure that everyone can have a safer experience that allows for belonging on Discord.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>The publication of this Transparency Report marks our sixth since 2019. This report covers the second half of 2021, from July through December 2021. With this, we’ve completed our <a href=\"https://discord.com/tags/transparency-reports\">reports from 2019 to 2021</a> and are looking to expand and increase our transparency reporting efforts from 2022 onwards.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’re committed to providing more useful insight into the enormous effort that goes into making Discord a safe place for all and welcome your feedback on how to improve these reports. <br><br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Report Structure Updates</strong></h2>\n            <p>We spent the past few months thinking deeply about how we present our data to you, making sure the story we’re telling is the most accurate representation of how Discord enforces its Guidelines. In the past, we’ve made changes to our reports in the categorization of policy types on our platform.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In doing so, we recognize that we’ve made it difficult to compare older reports to one another. Moving forward, our goal is to enable you to easily review and compare data from report to report.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In this Transparency Report, we recategorized our safety matrix and shifted from 14 categories to 11 new categories:</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:2800pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/62462625c0af9e5a50810466_Recategorize.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the Safety Category Updates chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-December-2021/blob/main/H2%202021%20Transparency%20Report%20-%20Category%20Updates.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>We’re also restructuring the design of our Transparency Report. In the past, we showcased a high-level overview of user reports and actions taken.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In this report, we will continue to do that while adding a new section to individually discuss trends and analysis and provide additional context on a category-by-category basis. We hope the new addition will provide deeper insight into the trends we’ve seen on Discord.</p>\n            <p>Please note that <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/important-policy-updates\">our<strong> </strong>Community Guidelines were updated recently</a> to reflect several new and clarified policies. Since this report covers Discord’s safety efforts during the second half of 2021, the enforcement actions documented in this report are based on the previous version of our Community Guidelines.<br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Community Guidelines Enforcement</strong></h2>\n            <p>Discord publishes and maintains a comprehensive set of <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> that explains what is and isn’t allowed on the platform. Users and moderators are encouraged to submit reports if they suspect an account or server is violating our Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Discord reviews and analyzes these reports to determine if the content submitted violates our Guidelines. Depending on the severity, we may take a number of enforcement steps including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; disabling or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible; and potentially reporting them to law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Beyond reports, we invest heavily in our proactive efforts to detect and remove abuse before it’s reported to us. Through advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized Safety teams tackling specific abuse situations, and insight from experts outside the company, our team works to remove high-harm abuse before it is viewed by others.</p>\n            <p>This report details the actions that Discord has taken on accounts and servers that have violated our Community Guidelines and <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a>.<br><br></p>\n            <h2><strong>User Reports</strong></h2>\n            <h3><strong>Reports Received</strong></h3>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6244e99af5057bcae02de30d_gFIQ_RYi4LlgbiyOsnyyWf4gTyRy6WdYv9zGit8LVWV1wHTVdW2l8ZSOi8SVvJhKeb51i1KJy7PxWseU4Gv8YK8H47woEarlPRH2oRZ9EUlCCXXzsm0xQwQINOuhPiVXYcXMtDFR.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the Reports Received chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-December-2021/blob/main/H2%202021%20Transparency%20Report%20-%20Reports%20Received.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>While Discord welcomed even more people onto the platform during the second half of 2021, reports received decreased, with <strong>402,659 </strong>reports – down 34,531 from <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/discord-transparency-report-h1-2021\">the first half of 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>This decrease was the result of improving the user reporting experience by introducing a new one-click spam reporting feature built directly within the app.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>The one-click spam report feature, which was rolled out on all platforms in the second half of 2021, enables users to easily report spam with just one click, and without needing to leave Discord.

Action rates were high for issues such as Child Safety, Identity and Authenticity, and Violent and Graphic Content. Harassment and Bullying, the largest category of reports received had one of the lower action rates, at 18%, as oftentimes behavior interpreted and reported as harassment does not directly violate our Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Actions Taken on Accounts and Servers</strong></h2>\n            <h3><strong>Account and Server Warnings</strong></h3>\n            <p>Warnings are issued to accounts and servers and are used frequently to correct problematic behavior that does not require immediate permanent removal from the platform.

We review appeal requests and reinstate accounts if we determine that a mistake was made, or if we have good faith in the user’s appeal that they have recognized the violation made for a lower-harm issue and will abide by our Community Guidelines once back on Discord.</p>\n            <p>We received<strong> 175,393 appeals</strong> for issues not including spam during the second half of 2021, a 68% increase in appeals<strong> </strong>from the previous reporting period. <strong>5,661</strong>, or 0.34% of the 1,687,082 accounts disabled, were reinstated. This low number of appeals granted when compared to the careful consideration that goes into reviewing appeals reflects the high degree of accuracy in actions taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Enforcement Trend Analysis</strong></h2>\n            <p>In this new addition to our Transparency Report, we’ll break down each category and go into detail about the subcategories and trends within each one.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Child Safety</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for anyone who endangers children. Users who upload abuse material of minors to Discord are reported to NCMEC and removed from the platform. We deeply value our partnership with NCMEC to ensure that grooming and endangerment cases are quickly escalated to authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, we reported <strong>15,126 accounts</strong> to NCMEC. 14,906 of those reports were images or videos, of which many were flagged through PhotoDNA. 220 high-harm grooming or endangerment reports were also delivered to NCMEC. Overall, this represented a 56.8% increase in reports made to NCMEC during the second half of 2021 when compared to the first half of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6244e99b4c6f8f1f1573d559_LpfYZ1lvZZZna__QqV3E7JAhC4ukfa9UqZ_5DtwyRSX02piA3b9_-l4HL-dvUH_cCEhfAX1uvN6DLRGPQVHZHi_q9Q83PSsbZFwA6EeNG5yfC-rzYcorWFAAspPv1YQp7KHA9bFh.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the Reports filed to NCMEC chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-December-2021/blob/main/H2%202021%20Transparency%20Report%20-%20NCMEC.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Beyond reporting to NCMEC, our team focuses on proactively removing users who are posting SCRM, which is the single largest individual category of accounts disabled, accounting for <strong>1,124,307 accounts</strong> disabled and <strong>11,314 servers</strong> removed.</p>\n            <p>Child-harm content is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord or the internet at large. Our highest priority is to remove this content from our platform, and we work with industry peers and law enforcement to ensure that this effort extends beyond Discord. We’ve built a dedicated team for this work and invest heavily in advanced tooling and education so parents know how our service works and understand the controls that can contribute to creating a positive and safe experience for their children.</p>\n            <p>Discord has been an active partner in cross-industry programs and is a member of the Technology Coalition, the Family Online Safety Institute, the National Parent Teacher Association, ConnectSafely, as well as an annual sponsor of the Dallas Crime Against Children Convention.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Deceptive Practices</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of distributing malware, sharing or selling game hacks or cheats, and theft of authentication tokens is a violation of our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>For context, in our last Transparency Report, we reported on hacks &amp; cheats and malware as two distinct categories which are now reported on together in this new category.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>19,643 accounts</strong> for Deceptive Practices. One notable trend is that accounts disabled for authentication token theft rose by 740% when compared to the first half of 2021. This increase was a result of a focus on account takeover cases. You can read more about our efforts to reduce account takeover and educate users <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/protecting-users-from-scams-on-discord\">here</a>.</p>\n            <p>A total of <strong>6,601 servers</strong> were removed for this category, with servers removed for token theft up more than 450% from our last report.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Exploitative and Unsolicited Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>It is a violation of our Community Guidelines to share or promote sexually explicit content of other people without their consent as well as non-consensual intimate materials.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>155,871 accounts</strong> and removed <strong>7,604 servers </strong>for Exploitative and Unsolicited Content. This category was the second-largest category of accounts disabled.</p>\n            <p>Exploitative and Unsolicited Content is an area where we’re constantly investing in proactive measures. For non-consensual pornography, leaks and sexually degrading content, we removed 19.3%, 21.7%, and 16.9% of servers proactively.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Harassment and Bullying</strong></h3>\n            <p>Harassment and bullying have no place on Discord. Continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments, circumventing bans, suggestive threats, the sharing of someone’s personally identifiable information (also known as doxxing), and raiding are violations of our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>In our last Transparency Report, we reported on doxxing and raiding as two distinct categories which are now reported here.<br></p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, <strong>32,432 accounts</strong> were disabled for harassment-related behavior, and <strong>1,867</strong> <strong>servers</strong> were removed for this issue.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Hateful Conduct</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord doesn’t allow the organization, promotion, or participation in hate speech or hateful conduct.</p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, <strong>20,295 accounts</strong> and <strong>2,772</strong> <strong>servers</strong> were removed for this issue. The number of accounts disabled was down 21.5% when compared to the first half of the year, while servers removed for this issue were up by more than 114% over the same time period. Accounts are most often disabled individually, or with the removal of a server.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>When servers are removed, the owner’s account is automatically disabled and if necessary so too are accounts of moderators and or users if the behavior and or participation is widespread. With updated operational procedures for Hateful Conduct, more servers may have been removed without all members leading to this inverse trend.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Identity and Authenticity</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of coordinating and participating in malicious impersonation of individuals or organizations is a violation of our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>As one of the smaller categories, we disabled <strong>3,950 accounts</strong> and removed <strong>17</strong> <strong>servers</strong> for this issue.</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Platform Manipulation</strong></h3>\n            <p>Spam, fake accounts, and self-bots are all examples of platform manipulation that damage the experience of our users and violate our Community Guidelines.</p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, <strong>16,490 accounts</strong> and <strong>2,941</strong> <strong>servers</strong> were removed for platform manipulation-related issues not related to spam. An additional <strong>46,326,661 accounts</strong> were disabled for spam or spam-related offenses.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’re focused on combating spam and minimizing users’ exposure to spammers and spam content on Discord. We recently established a dedicated cross-functional anti-spam team combining Engineering, Data, Product, and Safety resources to tackle this issue, and we rolled out a one-click spam reporting feature that enables users to easily report spam. Currently, 95% of accounts disabled for spam are done so proactively – before we receive any user report.</p>\n            <p>You can read more about how Discord fights spam <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-is-fighting-spam\">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Regulated or Illegal Activities</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord for the purpose of engaging in regulated, illegal, or dangerous activities is strictly prohibited, including selling or facilitating the sale of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods, phishing, DDoS, and other forms of social engineering.</p>\n            <p>We disabled <strong>66,774 accounts</strong> for engaging in this behavior. 41,447 accounts were disabled for engaging with regulated or illegal goods, an increase of more than 2,000%, while 25,327 accounts were disabled for other cybercrime-related behavior. The large increase in accounts disabled is the result of an internal operational shift that clarified how to action accounts engaging in these behaviors.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>A total of <strong>8,101 servers</strong> were removed for this category, with 583 servers removed for engaging with regulated or illegal goods, an increase of more than 150%. 7,518servers were removed for other cybercrime-related abuse, a decrease of 10% when compared to the first half of 2021. 73.41 and 52% of these respective servers were removed proactively.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Self-Harm Concerns</strong></h3>\n            <p>Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Actions may be taken on accounts or servers sharing or encouraging people to cut themselves, embrace eating disorders, or otherwise manipulate and coerce other users to engage in acts of self-harm. These actions are only taken on accounts glorifying or promoting acts of self-harm, not on users seeking help or in need of medical attention.</p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, <strong>1,378 accounts</strong> were disabled for posting such content, an increase of 10% from the first half of the year.</p>\n            <p>We removed <strong>412</strong> <strong>servers</strong> for self-harm concerns. This reflects a 22% decline when compared to the first half of the year.</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Violent and Graphic Content</strong></h3>\n            <p>Real media depicting gore, excessive violence, the glorification of violence, or animal cruelty with the intent to harass or shock others is not allowed on Discord.</p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, <strong>51,955 accounts</strong> were disabled for posting such content. 36,120 of these accounts were disabled for gore, and the remaining 15,835 accounts were disabled for content glorifying violence. This was an increase of 129% and 33% from the first half respectively.</p>\n            <p>We also removed <strong>2,663</strong> <strong>servers</strong> for violent and graphic content. Of these, 1,018 servers were removed for gore, and 1,645 servers were removed for content glorifying violence. The number of servers removed for gore remained the same as in the first half of the year, while the number of servers removed for glorification of violence increased by 57%.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h3><strong>Violent Extremism</strong></h3>\n            <p>We consider violent extremism to be the support, encouragement, promotion, or organization of violent acts or ideologies that advocate for the destruction of society, often by blaming certain individuals or groups and calling for violence against them.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord\">This blog post</a> discusses our methods to address violent extremism on our platform. Through partnering and engaging in cross-industry work with the Global Forum To Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) and other organizations, we’ve made progress in our tooling, policy, and subject matter expertise to ensure that violent extremism does not have a home on Discord.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>In the second half of 2021, <strong>24,444 accounts</strong> and <strong>2,182 servers</strong> were removed for violent extremism. This reflects a 10% increase in the number of servers removed since the last reporting period. We dedicate significant resources to proactively removing violent extremism from our platform — during this reporting period, 47.5% of these servers removed were done so proactively.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Information Requests</strong></h2>\n            <p>When appropriate, Discord complies with information requests from law enforcement agencies while respecting the privacy and rights of our users.</p>\n            <p>Law enforcement must provide valid legal documentation for the requested information. We review each information request to ensure legal compliance.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Discord may also disclose user data to law enforcement in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is an imminent risk of serious physical harm.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h3><strong><br>Legal Requests</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord received <strong>2,852 </strong>pieces<strong> </strong>of legal process during the second half of 2021. We complied with the majority of those requests, ultimately finding <strong>2,559</strong> of them both legally valid and specific enough for us to identify a user and produce the relevant information. We work to limit disclosures of user information and content so they match the specific circumstances dictated by each request.&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6244e99b1afbc932964e0643_xef42nG-XmGEOXl-ZpGZn9eOX4-qSUY4zgQK0QuudSCIxG-dMF470URx-7OWuzSBxePMD5NQGgvy_qPbaCjwwakpB0xD84DRYFlhmEgd6dauyoEdJzkqwKf7zr8hwUqJcQacguS7.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>A text version of the Requests from Law Enforcement chart is available <a href=\"https://github.com/DiscordBlog/Discord-Transparency-Report-July-December-2021/blob/main/H2%202021%20Transparency%20Report%20-%20Legal%20Requests.csv\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <h3><strong>Emergency Requests</strong></h3>\n            <p>Discord received <strong>346 </strong>emergency disclosure requests from law enforcement during this period. These requests originated from law enforcement agencies around the world. We disclose user data to law enforcement absent legal process only when there is imminent risk of serious physical injury or death.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We were able to identify 277 accounts based on the information provided by law enforcement for these requests and disclosed basic subscriber information in <strong>162</strong> emergency disclosure requests.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Intellectual Property Removal Requests</strong></h2>\n            <p>For the first time, we are reporting on intellectual property removal requests from our platform. Our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service prohibit the sharing of content that infringes third-party intellectual property rights. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Discord will remove content and/or accounts in connection with claims of copyright infringement on our platform.</p>\n            <p>We review each DMCA notice to ensure that reports are valid and complete and that they are made in good faith.</p>\n            <p>Discord received <strong>2,080 </strong>facially valid DMCA takedown notifications, of which <strong>1,956 </strong>provided information sufficient for content removal upon review.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2><strong><br>Our Commitment to Safety and Transparency</strong></h2>\n            <p>Imagine a place where you can talk, hang out with your friends, and find belonging in a welcoming and safer environment: it doesn’t just happen. It takes immense effort, collaboration, and dedication from all of us at Discord. From Engineering to Data, Product to Policy, and Community Moderation to Trust &amp; Safety, we strive to build the best platform for people around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’re proud of the work that we do to help keep people and communities on Discord safe. We hope that as a result of this work, you’re able to feel safer and find your own sense of belonging in the communities on Discord you call home.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Our commitment to safety and transparency is everlasting. We hope that <a href=\"https://discord.com/tags/transparency-reports\">these Transparency Reports</a>, alongside our <a href=\"https://discord.com/category/safety\">Policy &amp; Safety Blog</a> will continue to educate and inspire others toward building a safer digital world.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

I’m Calixta, founder of the Voice Acting Central Discord: a community catering to Voice Actors and helping them grow in their own way. <br><br>Today, I’m sharing my own guidance on navigating the voice acting industry, which consists of professionals who work in a variety of jobs: from directing, audio engineering, dubbing work, and even animation. Typical jobs for voice actors can be as small and quick as 30-second ads, or as large as a multiple-season show.<br></p>\n            <p>I’ve broken this guide into five simple tips that I bring to the Voice Acting server that can be applicable across the industry and to other communities:<br></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Hone your networking skills</li>\n                <li>Attend community events to refine your abilities</li>\n                <li>Don’t be afraid of competition</li>\n                <li>Learn to accept rejection</li>\n                <li>Utilize community to overcome obstacles<br></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Throughout this, it’s also important to understand the challenges you’ll face. And sometimes, things won’t turn out the way you’d like — and that’s okay!&nbsp;</p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/621fe0511bd41824d1f83e18_JYjbGM04otQKERlUgbnG1tPLNPQVz4qoIvDKAN5FoN-M17X98cZtzbN78AUAMqLlNbMKvBo6SdKaa_tZEjJqIqIeNd3N6ZtcCKx01HUixuhp-srdkU6glNi37taNjM43GXVlquNZ.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <h2><strong>Network to Net More Work&nbsp;</strong><br></h2>\n            <p>Like many industries, the Voice Acting industry relies on connecting with people. When looking to network, find a common interest or ground. Maybe they’re an animator and you’re a writer; this could result in a collaborative effort between you two. Be sure to do some research on their past work: check their portfolio, do a simple Google search, or follow them on social media. Connection and effort is key.<br></p>\n            <p>If you have strong ties to people, there’s a good chance they might introduce you to their extended networks and help you land you a gig. If you notice an open casting call that someone else would be a great fit for, be sure to pay it forward and share that opportunity with them!&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>Attend Events and Have Your Voice Heard</strong></h2>\n            <p>Speaking of networking, being in a community is all about coming together with others. In our Voice Acting Community server, we encourage members to participate in server events such as Open Mic Nights, Improv Shows, and Voice Acting Competitions to test their skills and get constructive, real-time feedback.<br></p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6222947bc179e6ff7a62f701_qdiITd3GtZObE6dMhczIUL4dMsH3QTu9wHVoXYk0af1bxEZIpu8rppbKgKKq1PETPtHmbzWqkuHv0c5NpeHVpTHpCwjN3ocEhwdIG0Rq98ZEhwtudmSDhrpF2ZFsnFgCa0lDwQqP.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n                <figcaption>Looking to run an event of your own? Consider using <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722-Stage-Channels-FAQ#h_01F22AKG1WM0JYC69N1JW22JBZ\">Discord’s Stage channels </a>to have a controlled environment for running and scheduling audio events.<br></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            <p>During our server’s events, many talented and experienced actors come together and get to know each other. In particular, our Q&amp;As showcase industry veterans that have years of experience in the field who are willing to share their expertise and advice with aspiring voice actors to help them get where they want to be.<br>‍<br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Approach Competition by Understanding Your Range</strong></h2>\n            <p>Competition is always relevant in the voice acting community: it’s part of the job. Auditioning against others to land that one gig? The thrill when you’re accepted or the heartbreak when you’re passed over? It’s always lingering in the back of your head.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>No matter the outcome, remember: don’t compare your talents to others. You are your own voice, and you will shine in your own way while auditioning.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>Try to find your own voice range and strength. Do you fit in a lower voice range or a higher one? Do you have a more feminine, masculine, or androgynous tone? To help define what your range is, connect with someone with more experience — such as a vocal teacher or director — who can help explain what your range best fits.&nbsp;<br>‍</p>\n            <h2><strong>Learn Acceptance</strong><br></h2>\n            <p>When I first started out voice acting, I had a friend who loved to voice-act and was excited to land their first role. She auditioned for a role that she was very confident about landing. While she did great, the director opted to choose someone else. She was distraught and confused with jealousy. “How could I have not been chosen,” she asked?<br><br>It’s then that I shared something important that an actor in any field should always keep in mind: it doesn't matter if you were “better”, but rather “did you fit the description of what the director was looking for?”<br></p>\n            <p>If you don’t land a role, remember that rejection is one of many steps on the road to success, and how you respond to it is one of the best indicators of your character.<br>‍<br></p>\n            <h2><strong>Overcome Challenges and Build Community</strong></h2>\n            <p>Being a woman in the Voice Acting industry can be demanding. On the internet, the criticism and feedback you get isn’t always constructive. In the worst cases, you may experience harassment. So how do you move past that and strive to be better than those who seek to tear those down around them?&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>You build community: one that supports and lends an ear to every member that participates in it. When I went through some rough times, my community had my back. The amount of love this community has is immense and I couldn’t see myself without them today.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6226a3fe1da7d84ca9693613_V65UiBhNjdy_uL5NDAPROgDQKIK_8NgtllDWc_L2Egx3KSIIkYUee-e55M1pgkewLbzJuPjLhKWAN8SkvGIyG2jHyGoN7WnaBdxSm5WBTw_C8AWbpDfbYekFTOflUFtYu3FK_2u3.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>Keep your head held high and support one another, which in itself can bring endless possibilities.<br></p>\n            <figure style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/621fe0505c96b37951dff5dd_OJ3g_Y5aAREQeo59klpoZwGn4hg4Nt4tngQnCwQu2lvC5ZmdcheqTLXNd1ZOjLnhsn2M-09oq7yVdGnlB7gl5kbJ3rRzA21ZOWOWmHMvyPUEH6BDoRhbI5FkIn4Zt3unYPfjjMYB.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n            <p>I hope this has been helpful guidance for you, and that you might take some actionable steps to get more involved in growing in your own community or industry.

For non-English, <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4470228640279\">head to our Help Center</a> and select your preferred language at the top-right.</h6>\n            <p>The update to our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> announced today introduces a provision disallowing forms of misinformation on our platform. This is an important step in the development of our rules governing user content and behaviors.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>The new guideline states that users <strong>may not share false or misleading information on Discord that is likely to cause physical or societal harm </strong>— including content that could result in damage to physical infrastructure, injury to others, the obstruction of participation in civic processes, or that could endanger the public health.<br><br>We would like to dive a bit deeper into the rule against health misinformation. Ensuring the accuracy of online health information has never been as important as during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is our hope that this new rule will be an effective countermeasure against dangerous medical-related falsehoods — both during the pandemic and after its conclusion.</p>\n            <h2>Overview of the Policy</h2>\n            <p>The early days of COVID-19 demonstrated our collective need for rigorous medical science from trustworthy sources. The personal health choices made during this time had the potential to impact communities and the world. False or misleading health information continues today to have potential to cause harm: It can prompt individuals to make unsafe choices; it can obscure important information about diseases; and it can lead to undermining of public health protocols.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            <p>We do not allow individuals on Discord to <strong>post, promote, or organize communities around false or misleading health information that is likely to result in harm</strong>. This includes:<br></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>anti-vaccination content;&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>medically unsupported and dangerous cures for disease;&nbsp;</li>\n                <li>content that distorts information about a disease; and,</li>\n                <li>any content that could hinder the resolution of a public health emergency.<br></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>We consider health information “false or misleading” if it directly and unequivocally contradicts the most recent consensus reached by the medical community. Our standard for actioning <em>requires</em> that the content be likely to cause some form of harm. A non-exhaustive list of potential harms includes: heightening risk of exposure to a transmissible disease; causing undue strain on public health systems; and inciting panic or social unrest with conspiratorial health claims.<br></p>\n            <p>Discord users also may not post or promote content that <strong>attempts to sway opinion through the use of sensationalized, alarmist, or hyperbolic language</strong>, or any content that <strong>repeats widely-debunked health claims, unsubstantiated rumors, or conspiratorial narratives.</strong>‍</p>\n            <h2>Criteria for Actioning and Exceptions</h2>\n            <p>We will take action against individuals, small groups, and servers that post, promote, or organize around content that makes false or misleading claims about any of the following:<br></p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>the safety, side effects, or efficacy of vaccines;</li>\n                <li>the ingredients, development, or approval of vaccines;</li>\n                <li>alternative, unapproved treatments for disease (including claims that promote harmful forms of self-medication, as well as claims advocating vaccine refusal or alternatives);</li>\n                <li>the existence or prevalence of a disease;</li>\n                <li>the transmission or symptoms of a disease;</li>\n                <li>health guidance, advisories, or mandates (including false claims about preventative measures and actions that could hinder the resolution of a public health emergency);</li>\n                <li>the availability or eligibility for health services; and,</li>\n                <li>content that implies a health conspiracy by malicious forces (including claims that could cause social unrest or prompt the destruction of critical infrastructure).<br></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>This policy is <em>not</em> intended to be punitive of polarizing or controversial viewpoints. We allow the sharing of <strong>personal health experiences</strong>; <strong>opinions and commentary</strong> (so long as such views are based in fact and will not lead to harm); <strong>good-faith discussions</strong> about medical science and research; content intended to <strong>condemn or debunk</strong> health misinformation; and <strong>satire and humor</strong> that obviously and deliberately intends to mock false or misleading health claims.</p>\n            <h2>Enforcing This Policy</h2>\n            <p>We determine the severity of a violation by weighing four main factors: the <strong>gravity of the harm likely to result</strong> from the content; the poster’s <strong>intent to convince</strong> others that the false or misleading information is true; the poster’s <strong>apparent intent to deceive</strong> others into believing the misinformation; and whether the poster or group has had <strong>repeated violations of this policy</strong>.<br></p>\n            <p>We may take any number of enforcement actions in response to violations of this policy — including warning an account, server, or entire moderator team; temporarily suspending an account; removing harmful content; and permanently suspending an account or server.&nbsp;</p>\n            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n            <p>Digital misinformation is harmful because it hinders people’s ability to come to well-reasoned conclusions — and it does so at a rate faster than what is possible with in-person dialogue.

We want people to enjoy our platform, but never at the expense of others. We also know that the ability to have a safe and positive experience can be affected by things that happen outside of Discord.<br></p>\n            <p>Some types of <strong>off-platform behaviors</strong> can reasonably create a safety risk - or even immediate and severe harm - for people who use Discord. When we talk about off-platform behaviors, we’re referring to any behaviors taking place outside of Discord, either in other digital spaces or in a physical community. If we become aware of specific off-platform, high-harm behaviors with credible evidence committed by a person with a Discord account, <strong>we will take the off-platform harmful behavior into consideration</strong> when assessing whether that account has violated a specific Community Guideline. Our Trust &amp; Safety team may launch an investigation of an account, including reviewing the user’s activity and posts, based on this off-platform behavior.<br></p>\n            <p>We are taking this step to ensure the safety of everyone on Discord and in the communities they live in. We are applying this off-platform behavior consideration <strong>only</strong> if we become aware of highest-harm threats, including organizing, promoting, or supporting violent extremism, making threats of violence, carrying out acts of violence, or sexualizing children in any way.</p>\n            <p>Harmful off-platform behaviors may include:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Recruiting or participating in activities within a known violent group</li>\n                <li>Explicit and/or credible threats of violence toward a person, group of people, organization, event, or location</li>\n                <li>Carrying out acts of violence, such as a mass shooting or acts of human trafficking</li>\n                <li>Links to content or content posted that depicts minors in a pornographic, sexually suggestive, or violent manner. This also applies to inappropriate contact with minors (also known as “grooming”) made on other platforms or in a physical space.<br></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Credible evidence may include:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Public content posted on another platform that can be confidently attributed to a Discord user</li>\n                <li>Note: Content altered with the intention to frame a user will not be considered, and false reporting may result in action by Trust &amp; Safety.</li>\n                <li>Law enforcement actions or requests</li>\n                <li>Legal requests</li>\n                <li>Press coverage of the behavior by a reputable journalistic source<br></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>When considering reported incidents under this policy, we will assess the account with <a href=\"http://restorativejustice.org/restorative-justice/about-restorative-justice/tutorial-intro-to-restorative-justice/lesson-1-what-is-restorative-justice/#sthash.10RfzmHH.dpbs\"><strong>restorative justice principles</strong></a> in mind. We may decline to take action on the account if: the off-platform behavior occurred in the distant past; the person has gone through a credible rehabilitation process, or they received justice-oriented punishment in the past (such as required time at a correctional facility); <strong>and</strong> the investigation and assessment shows there is no evidence of the behavior taking place on Discord. We also may remove an account from suspension based on an appeal.<br></p>\n            <p>We are committed to making Discord a safe place where people can find community and belonging. We believe this policy will help us gather a more comprehensive accounting of a user’s behavior and potential for harm when we investigate violations of our Community Guidelines, and take action if warranted to protect our community. </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div class=\"column-4 w-col w-col-8 w-col-stack\">\n    <div id=\"heading-1\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <p>Data is at the very heart of how we understand and improve the Discord experience of our users all across the world! In this blog post, we’ll discuss how Data Science contributes to Discord’s mission: how we function, what makes us unique, and what’s coming next! (Plus, <a href=\"https://discord.com/jobs?team=data-science\">we’re hiring</a>!)</p>\n            <p>The mission of the Data Science team is simple: we want to improve decision-making and inform strategy through the analysis, modeling, visualization, and distribution of information.</p>\n            <p>Easy enough, right? So how do we do this?<br>‍</p>\n            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>\n            <p>Data Science is an overloaded term in tech. <strong>Here at Discord, Data Science combines the full spectrum of analytics, machine learning, and causal inference into one team.</strong> This cross-disciplinary structure lets us leverage the right combination of skills and knowledge to overcome the challenges that we and our partners (e.g. Product) face — and learn from one another in the process. Regardless of what the solution is, we can solve it — and our partners trust us to do so.</p>\n            <p>We have three general Data Scientist archetypes: Analytics, Machine Learning, and Causal Inference. The responsibilities between these archetypes have some ambiguity and overlap — and that’s ok!</p>\n            <p>At the end of the day, we’re all problem solvers. In general:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Analytics Data Scientists leverage their deep analytical skills and product intuition to solve a wide array of complex problems — from strategic analysis to dashboard creation and experimentation design and analysis. Recent projects include building experimentation metrics pipelines and dashboards (an incredible challenge, given the scale and complexity of our product!) and conducting deep-dive analysis into the impact of holiday events.</li>\n                <li>Machine Learning Data Scientists apply their deep expertise in supervised and unsupervised learning to develop predictive models for internal usage. These models leverage state-of-the-art technology to balance performance and interpretability, providing insights, guiding strategy, and powering downstream analytics and modeling. Feature engineering often gets complicated due to the nonlinear (and long-tail) behaviors of our users! Recent ML projects include constructing a suite of calibrated models to understand the long-term value of subscribers as well as forecasting Discord’s growth for years to come.</li>\n                <li>Causal Inference Data Scientists develop, use, and evangelize novel methodologies to understand the causal impact of product features and consumer offers through A/B testing and quasi-experimentation. One recent CI project used Bayesian Structural Time Series to understand the impact of a marketing campaign based on a recent geo test.<br>‍</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h3>Team Structure &amp; Partnership</h3>\n            <p>Modern Data Science organizations are typically structured as:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Centralized: data scientists operate as consultants throughout the company</li>\n                <li>Embedded: data scientists directly report to business units</li>\n                <li>Some hybrid approach</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p><strong>At Discord, we’ve decided to take a hybrid approach</strong> - combining the benefits of a centralized function with the strengths of individual sub-teams that are aligned 1:1 with major company pillars. In this way, we can progress towards a broad ambitious data vision for the company — including developing the right foundations, establishing best practices, and building a data community — while still providing deep direct support needed to drive the success of specific business and product initiatives.</p>\n            <p>The key areas we support include:</p>\n            <ul role=\"list\">\n                <li>Growth: Optimize the user experience, covering everything from streamlining registration flows to helping users find new servers and friends</li>\n                <li>Revenue: Grow our premium subscription services, Nitro &amp; Boosting, through development and continued improvement of high-value product features</li>\n                <li>Marketing: Improve awareness of product features and consumer offers</li>\n                <li>Communities, Channel Activities, and Bots/APIs: Build and maintain capability for communities on Discord to grow and flourish</li>\n                <li>Safety: Help make Discord a safer place for all of our users</li>\n                <li>Messaging &amp; Experience: Improve the core A/V and messaging functionality that makes Discord an amazing platform for its users to find belonging</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Across DS teams, we pride ourselves on hyper-collaborative partnerships. Oftentimes, Data Science teams operate within a company as service teams, brought in late in the product development lifecycle to conduct an analysis or build a dashboard or write a query. <strong>Data Science at Discord is a partner team, not a service team.</strong> We focus on proactive and strategic relationships with product managers, marketers, and engineering managers, partnering with these teams from ideation all the way to post-deployment. As part of that process, we focus on scaling (ourselves and our partners), building self-service tools, and strategic impact.</p>\n            <p>Data Science also couldn’t bring data to bear on solving problems without a close partnership with the Data Platform team. We work hand-in-hand with our engineering partners to identify and build infrastructure needs, novel capabilities, and high-leverage solutions to problems ranging from democratizing experimentation at scale to automated data quality checks.<br>‍</p>\n            <h3>Team Culture</h3>\n            <p>Skills and structure provide a framework for success but a world-class Data Science organization also requires the right culture. <strong>All of our data scientist roles are deeply technical positions that interface directly with business and product staff.</strong> This powerful combination of technical and business acumen means our data scientists are in high demand and drive outsized impact. Teams want to work with us, and data scientists love what they do. Jason has written about our company culture <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/the-four-values-of-working-at-discord\">here</a> and these cultural tenets form a foundation for how we operate.</p>\n            <p>Data scientists at Discord seek to be hyper collaborative so that other teams proactively seek us out, knowing that we are invested in solutions. Everyone on the team is a leader — data scientists are empowered with autonomy and agency to proactively figure out solutions quickly and efficiently. <strong>Excellent judgement and strong communication skills are a must</strong>, and data scientists should know how to share ideas and progress with a variety of audiences, know when to collect feedback and know when to charge ahead.</p>\n            <p>We also recognize that none of us are perfect and value modesty and vulnerability. We want to grow as data scientists, professionals, and people and therefore invest heavily in direct, candid, and empathetic feedback — even in our interview process!<br>‍</p>\n            <h3>Join Us!</h3>\n            <p>Data Science at Discord is quickly growing and evolving. In fact, we’re building out a sister Data Engineering organization starting in 2022! If you enjoy solving challenging problems using massive data sets and state-of-the-art technology, working with incredible partners at an amazing and unique company, and like what you read above — please consider joining us on our journey!</p>\n            <p>For more information on available roles in Data at Discord, be sure to check out our current job listings for the Data Science team here: <a href=\"https://discord.com/jobs?team=data-science\">https://discord.com/jobs?team=data-science</a>.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-8\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-9\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-10\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

But you notice something’s not right. The link looks right but something seems…off. You notice their speaking patterns aren’t the most human. They claim you did things you know you have never done. They seem in a rush and are warning you that you gotta get in on what they’re offering fast or you’ll lose out. They never posted in any of your mutual servers, or don’t even share mutual servers with you, but they want to speak to YOU. </p>\n            <p>You might have heard about scams like this happening on Discord recently. Or it might have even happened to you. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/crypto-scam-ftc-2079c3b2-6237-4ff8-92f2-d08382cd0d70.html\">You're not alone, and it’s not just Discord—the FTC says online scams surged in 2021</a>. Our mission has always been to make Discord the best place on the internet for people to find belonging and we’re amazed to see all the different interests that have brought communities together, from study sessions to NFT drops, and even houseplant care. But we’ve also seen some unfriendly characters try to exploit those communities. </p>\n            <p>So we want to share some of the additional measures we’re taking on our end and go over ways you can protect yourself and others on Discord. You may already know some of these tips and tricks, but a refresher never hurts. &nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>This is in no way an exhaustive list</strong>. It’s an unfortunate reality that bad actors online will change and evolve their tactics, but so can you.

Our newest class of Discord Interns has left their mark on the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>They came from different places and focused on different fields, but they all worked on one overarching goal: to help make Discord better for everyone. They’ve all grown immensely, overcome challenges, and even flew in to meet each other in person during this year’s company-wide on-site event!&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>So, let’s meet ‘em! We sat down with this year’s Discord Interns to ask them how they found the opportunity to spend a summer at Discord, what they learned, and advice for anyone looking to become an Intern in the future!&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"btn-wrapper w-condition-invisible\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"btn-blog w-dyn-bind-empty w-button\"></a></div>\n    <div id=\"heading-2\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>⭐️ Meet the Discord Intern Class of 2023! ⭐️</strong></h2>\n            <p><strong>Serrana</strong>, a <em>Software Engineering- Machine Learning Platform</em> <em>Intern</em>, grew up in Uruguay and was living abroad during Covid. During the height of the pandemic, Serrana started using Discord to help feel less alone.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Lee</strong>, this year’s<strong> </strong><em>Legal</em> <em>Intern</em>, discovered their passion for Law during college and took the opportunity to join Discord as a summer Intern for more hands-on in the legal field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Thijs</strong> joined as a <em>Product Engineering - Messaging</em> <em>Intern</em>, but this wasn’t their first Discord development experience — he’s already an App developer for the well-known <a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/application-directory/692045914436796436\">Truth or Dare</a> Discord app in over a million servers.</p>\n            <p>Computer science student <strong>Caleb</strong> joined Discord this year as a <em>Product Engineering - Design Systems</em> <em>Intern</em>. Thanks to their inspiring college professor, web development and UI/UX quickly became their focused passion.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Liang</strong> is a data science and machine learning Ph.D. student, always wanting to learn how to apply ML models in real life, making Discord a great place to put some of that excitement to work as a <em>Data Science Intern - Machine Learning Intern</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Paul </strong>grew up in a small town in the Philippines, but his view of the world grew exponentially when he met friends from all over the world playing online games. Starting his adventures in Runescape and soon traveling to more than forty countries in the real world, he eventually moved to the US to study at Stanford and found an opportunity to be our Strategy and Business Planning Intern.</p>\n            <p><strong>Kaylee</strong> is a <em>Security Intern</em> who also happens to be a<strong> </strong>Stanford University student, is a computer science major and a long-time Discord user using the app for what it’s best known for: being a great place to game with friends.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Throughout these interviews, you’ll also see responses from <strong>Kelly</strong>, a <em>Product Engineering - Revenue Infrastructure Intern</em>, and <strong>Chenxi</strong>, who joined as a <em>Data Engineering Intern</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>We’d also like to give a shoutout to <strong>Janelle</strong>, this year’s <em>Product Design Intern</em> who made the banner on this very blog — it’s a beauty!</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af39ab3444cc7752b350bc_Yv1sVQ0PEYcPltp2fsAFFQGssZWaiOsM4weJl2lavF-vySTX0PcEhWMhmIOH-aZyp3MwRjPAq7tzCBNXzFXbQgUGv5-8ZpAy5pHqc5Dn7_CAkgpB13KP-CZar9DFAFeIHgRdDtYpJJ3mT2TqF2t8IKU.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-3\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>How’d you land an internship at Discord?</strong></h2>\n            <p><strong>Lee: </strong>Just through searching on LinkedIn. As soon as I saw Clyde, I literally jumped and thought, \"I have to at least try\". The interview process was amazing. I got to meet a ton of awesome people [who] gave me such great advice. When I was pushed to the next round, every time I thought, \"No way!”&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>The process was super transparent and I appreciate how open and honest everyone was. Shout out to the amazing Wendy Wu and Kiersten Sedlar for truly being amazing representatives of what it means to work at Discord.&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Thijs: </strong>It's been a dream for me for years to work here. Last year, I noticed it had come up on the jobs page. I didn't know who to contact, so I decided to email Jason directly! Jason had heard of some of my projects and forwarded me over to Stan and others who worked to make it possible (thank you &lt;3).&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>At first, I was surprised by the amount of interviews, but after starting I began to enjoy them. Most of the interviews were about who you are as a person and how you interact with others. I messed up a couple of times and had my dev environments fail, but the interviewers understood and cared. Despite only being on a call for an hour, we started to really feel like friends.</p>\n            <p><strong>Kaylee:</strong> I found this internship through the <a href=\"https://discord.com/careers\">Discord Careers</a> site (lol). The recruiting team put a great deal of care into making the process really personable and fun, which is pretty rare nowadays. I walked away from every interview feeling energized and having learned something new. Through my conversations, I could tell that employees were very enthusiastic [about] Discord’s mission and truly embodied the values.</p>\n            <p><strong>Paul:</strong> I stumbled upon this opportunity on Linkedin when I was searching for summer internships in the gaming space. I’ve always wanted to work in a gaming/gaming adjacent company and getting this internship was a dream come true. The kid in me who spent hours in internet cafes playing Runescape and League with friends is so happy I did this.<br><br>The process was quite different compared to other companies. People took the time to truly listen to me and get to know me as a person. It felt like a casual chat with a friend rather than some sort of test!</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600pxpx\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6500de3f4f7dd941e750b69a_Ny7HBGTFDyx5BSUqzVezJUSMxFNRYOWcKs8BYoTG_AcWXTzJeA4vsTp7_IeKb09qD7MzMfKeVyyjWHQ2xrHw2ZxNyCHiBhXua5N5aVGwERl6DPg_uLNkppFPMQE4ofU3i5Gg7P65NYvK_1hMwV1GVdA.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-4\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>What was your summer internship like? Walk us through what you worked on and accomplished. <br></strong></h2>\n            <p><strong>Chenxi<em>:</em></strong><em> </em>During my internship, I worked on server roles and permissions, which was both captivating and exhilarating. The mentorship I received played a significant role in ensuring a smooth onboarding process. I had lots of opportunities to tackle challenges but also received valuable guidance when needed. Support was one of the key factors contributing to the success of my internship, particularly the support from my mentor — shout out to my mentor a million more!<em><br><br></em><strong>Liang:<em> </em></strong>I worked on exploring a new method to quantify the strength of user connections at Discord. I built a social graph for the users at Discord and figured out user affinities from the graph structure. [Additionally], I evaluated the affinity score and compared it with the current production version.</p>\n            <p><strong>Serrana:</strong> I was given many “title” options, discussed each with my mentor and manager, then did a lot of research myself to come up with a problem that was both interesting to me and valuable for the team. After I had my project selected, I came up with a design and architecture that was discussed with the team. I really liked all the freedom I had to design the system; it allowed me to learn a lot about the company and plan my work in a way where each iteration would add value.</p>\n            <p>The final version was completed in about four weeks. This involved refactoring a big part of the team’s current system, learning completely new technologies, managing big amounts of data, and learning Discord-specific processes for testing things in staging. I really appreciate all the trust of the team in me to tackle this big task and the freedom I had when doing the work.</p>\n            <p><strong>Caleb: </strong>[It] was fantastic. I got to meet so many awesome and brilliant people here at Discord. My work consisted primarily of internal tooling: I built a mega Figma plugin called Mirage that consolidates a lot of our existing plugins into one mega plugin. Even though I was familiar with a lot of the tech I was working with on a day-to-day basis, I was always learning something, whether it be from the feedback I received on my code, discussions happening in our internal team chat, or from questions I was asking and the responses I was receiving.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6500df00062c5baa00807284_SQgoi-oqM6voauO7ifJ9VBXhui-9A7Y_iCluqMLcRYh2EZQ3embaZmKr1GSqfVsaCj4miY01a6V206EVrFtpkAtZv4iQkeQsEjcuFbYAqDJR5vm5UWkCNX734Mh0LCmp1EqFxwJUqIqtH6hzzQjMewA.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-5\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>What was your favorite part of your internship at Discord? <br></strong></h2>\n            <p><strong>Lee:</strong> Meeting everyone in person is a part of the internship that was definitely one of my favorites. You fall in love with everyone you meet online, just to fall in love all over again in person! (Also being surprised at everyone's height!)&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Caleb:</strong> HQ IRL!!! It was my first time flying since 2011 and I got to see so many things I never saw before. I hung out with all the Interns and met up with my team — it was genuinely the most emotional I’ve been during my internship. It made me realize that I needed to travel more and see everything the world has to offer. It was also so incredibly sad having to say goodbye to everyone after the Intern event and getting on my flight back home.</p>\n            <p><strong>Kaylee:</strong> All of my interactions with Discordians! Everyone at Discord is very warm and welcoming. Not only was my team very supportive and invested in my growth, but other Discord teams were also open and willing to expose Interns to different areas. Even though I was on the Security Team, I got to talk with people from Trust and Safety, Infrastructure, Revenue, and more! I really appreciated how genuine everyone was. People at Discord truly make the company what it is.</p>\n            <p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Without a doubt, my favorite part of my Discord internship was HQ IRL where Discord flew all the employees into San Francisco for a few days. From hilarious talk-show-style presentations to minigolf at Ghirardelli Square, I got to experience the palpable effect of Surprise and Delight in action at Discord.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/6500df148d1962a2f8cfc415_FAS-9HRiV0kZfghv4hU7tH-8Nlz50o3xHsK1pzLw6-AynplD4rZnztEEYOpcM3qaXeQfc2ERky0rz5Yun7g1RTy8PzQSNfu_fdC-SzpyCb92Xmrdj2qzq-JH2vRMl5YDtW69PcDO23TjbI0kYjWiJRA.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-6\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Last question, but the most important one: What advice do you have for future Discord Interns? <br></strong></h2>\n            <p><strong>Serrana:</strong> Ask questions and get to know as many people as possible. Everyone is very nice and talented around here, make sure to learn a lot.</p>\n            <p><strong>Lee:</strong> I'd have to say keep asking questions. No one is going to judge you for not knowing something, and you'd be surprised how many people at Discord get excited when you ask one. Take advantage of meeting with literally anyone you want in the organization, because everyone is willing to make time for you. Make the most of it!</p>\n            <p><strong>Thijs:</strong> Meet and talk to as many people as possible!</p>\n            <p><strong>Caleb:</strong> TALK! Communicate your feelings to your mentor, a buddy, or your manager. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone here wants to ensure you succeed! Most of all, if you visit San Francisco, BRING A JACKET!!! IT’S COLD!</p>\n            <p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Don’t be afraid to reach out to other Discordians! Everyone is genuinely so approachable and ready to share their experiences.</p>\n            <p><strong>Liang:</strong> Be enthusiastic about your project and don't be afraid to ask questions!</p>\n            <p><strong>Chenxi:</strong> Don’t be afraid to ask questions! Everyone here is so nice and willing to help. Learn as much as possible during these 12 weeks. It will be a truly meaningful, rewarding joinery I promise!&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><strong>Kaylee:</strong> Reach out to people and ask questions! The great thing about Discord is that there is a wide spectrum of roles and teams, but one uniting factor is that everyone is passionate about Discord and the people they work with.</p>\n            <figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\">\n                <div><img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/64af39ab3444cc7752b350bc_Yv1sVQ0PEYcPltp2fsAFFQGssZWaiOsM4weJl2lavF-vySTX0PcEhWMhmIOH-aZyp3MwRjPAq7tzCBNXzFXbQgUGv5-8ZpAy5pHqc5Dn7_CAkgpB13KP-CZar9DFAFeIHgRdDtYpJJ3mT2TqF2t8IKU.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n            </figure>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"heading-7\" class=\"rich-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"blog-post-content w-richtext\">\n            <h2><strong>Opportunities Are Open Constantly — Join Us! <br></strong></h2>\n            <p>You may have noticed that a lot of Interns mentioned they found their internship opportunities through our jobs board!
